A 21-year-old woman presented with a progressively growing small lesion in the right upper eyelid (RULP) over the past four hours.
She reported lying down in a rural house and was previously cleaning several farm animals.
She had no personal or family history of interest.
The examination revealed a reddish insect measuring 2 mm attached to the free edge of the PSD.
Visual acuity was unity in both eyes (OA) and the rest of the examination including the eye fundus was normal.
The treatment consisted in the application of a bastoncillo impregnated with mechero gasoline.
The progressive release of the jaws allowed the complete extraction with a forceps.
Pathological integrity was sent to the Anatomy Service to verify its integrity and to the Veterinary Faculty for its identification, being informed as RS or common dog tick.
The patient underwent exploration to rule out the presence of other arthropods and study of possible local or systemic complications.
Serology of tick-borne zoonoses was performed for six months, which were negative.
