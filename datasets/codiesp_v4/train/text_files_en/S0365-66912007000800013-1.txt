A 25-year-old male with macular haemorrhage secondary to ocular trauma.
His VA is 0.4 and his intraocular pressure is 15 mmHg.
Because the size of the hemorrhage is not very large, it was decided to start treatment with topical, oral and cycloplegic corticosteroids.
In the following week, from 0 to 0.1 and increased bleeding was observed. After positioning the patient with AV not perform posterior resection, bleeding was attempted with perfluorode displacing a gas dislodgement at week 50-PA.
Four weeks after the intervention, the VA was 0.8, but once the blood was reabsorbed, a juxtafoveolar choroidal rupture was observed.
At 6 months the VA is 1.0.
