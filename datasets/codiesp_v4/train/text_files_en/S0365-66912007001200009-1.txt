We studied a 57-year-old male patient with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension and ischemic heart disease due to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
His visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye.
He had previously been treated with argon laser panretinophotocoagulation in both eyes, as well as with adjunctive pars injections and hair coat with internal limiting macular edema and intravitreal diffuse macular hemorrhage D.
There were no residual neovascular membranes in the examination of the eye fundus, but microaneurysms and hemorrhages in the posterior pole of both eyes.
In the left eye, some RIMA were observed in the temporal area of the macula.
Fluorescein angiography was performed using 5 ml of 10% sodium fluorescein.
Equatorial ischemic areas and diffuse macular edema and AMIR in the left eye were observed, but no neovascular membranes were observed.
In this eye and after 8 minutes of angiogram, there was active bleeding from AMIR.
Eye movement left different traces of blood in the vitreous cavity.
Bleeding was brief and self-limiting, with no symptoms initially.
Soon after the patient began to notice myodesopsias.
Two weeks later, the vitreous haemorrhage resolved without consequences.
