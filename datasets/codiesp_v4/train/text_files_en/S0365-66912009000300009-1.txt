A 46-year-old male presented with a ten-day history of viral conjunctivitis in the right eye that did not improve with tobramycin and dexamethasone treatment.
Personal history included penile condyloma without urethritis for six months and permissive sexual relations at present.
Visual acuity in right eye perception and light.
The anterior pole of the right eye biocap shows superior thinning with imminent risk of ocular perforation, so the patient is treated with corneal filling with multi-amniotic membrane.
1.
Since the results of conjunctival exudate culture are positive for Neisseria Gonorrhoeae, antibiotic treatment is initiated intravenously with ceftriaxone at a dose of 1 g/12 h and topical treatment with ceftriaxone (50 days of reinforced eye).
One month later, the patient had a visual acuity of 0.8 in the right eye; in the anterior pole biomycosis, superior corneal fibrosis was observed with good transparency in the central part and well-formed anterior chamber.
