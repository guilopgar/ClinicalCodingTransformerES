A 56-year-old male patient with a history of positive serology for HIV hepatitis B presented with acute manifestations of hepatitis B which required urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
During the late postoperative period, one month after surgery, the patient developed a bilioma that was evacuated percutaneously.
Endoscopic cholangiography also performed biliary bypass.
As a result of the above, the patient has acute pancreatitis due to a peripancreatic collection.
This collection is evacuated by an initial percutaneous drainage, which proves to be insufficient presenting the patient an important retroperitoneal collection.
With no improvement and persistent drainage output associated with fever and deterioration of general status, computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was performed.
It reports encapsulated fluid with air-fluid level in the right flank adjacent to the abdominal wall, extending 17 cm in the craniocausal direction and 11 x 3 cm in transverse diameter.
1.
With diagnosis of extraperitoneal right parietocolic abscess drainage was performed by lumboscopy, evacuating abundant necrotic and purulent material.
Two faced pure silicone drains were placed, creating a continuous washing system, using physiological solution at a slow drop.
1.
The patient was admitted favorably with few febrile records.
The patient had a positive culture for Pseudomona Aureaginosa, which was treated with Meropenem during hospitalization.
On the fourth postoperative day, continuous washout was replaced by a voiding system and the patient was discharged.
During the follow-up, the patient continued to develop a fever and the drainage was stopped after the patient died.
