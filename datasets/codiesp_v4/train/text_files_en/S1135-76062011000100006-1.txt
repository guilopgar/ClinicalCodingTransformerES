A 27-year-old man who, during a police chase, received a gunshot in his skull.
Transferred to a care center, the patient died 24 hours after brain injury.
Among the autopsy findings, two scalp holes (right frontal and parietal) and a single bone entry orifice in the right parietal bone without bone outlet were found.
The skin entrance wound, without tattooing or smoking, is classified as "far away" or "long distance".
When the scalp was overflowed, a bone entry orifice was observed in the right parietal region, elongated, with external bi-sealing limited to the posterior area of the orifice, with a fracture line.
A fragment of the projectile is recovered in the right occipital region, deformed, of naked lead, caliber.38, with a sector of its surface "in spejo".
The rest of the projectile produces a cutaneous outlet orifice in the right parietal region, almost superimposed to the bone inlet orifice.
Histological examination confirms the nature of the cutaneous orifices.
