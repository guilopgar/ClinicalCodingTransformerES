The patient is a 61-year-old male.
The pathological antecedents were allergic to clarithromycin, suffering from esophageal stricture, essential tremor and chronic iron deficiency anemia.
His mother died after a renal carcinoma.
She underwent surgery in 2005 for renal carcinoma (p T3b Nx M1).
At the time of diagnosis he had bilateral adrenal metastases, metastatic lesion at lung level and liver dubious.
Right nephrectomy and left adrenalectomy were performed.
Subsequently, a clinical trial with interferon and beizumab began with partial response of the lesions.
In 2010, after the appearance of a parotid tumor, ultrasound-guided needle aspiration (FNAC) was performed, which was consistent with metastases from renal carcinoma.
To study the extent of the lesion a cervical magnetic resonance (MR) is performed in which a tumor is visualized at the right parotid level that compromises both the superficial and the deep lobe and that*3.4 cm tumor size is compatible with 2.6*
1.
Positron emission tomography (PET) performed showed a hypermetabolic lesion at the right parotid level compatible with metastatic process.
After the study by our tumor committee it was decided as treatment of choice to perform a radical parotidectomy due to the involvement of both parotid lobes.
1.
Pathology revealed a mass with morphological and immunohistochemical pattern compatible with metastasis of clear cell renal carcinoma.
For this characterization it was necessary to use cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), vimentin and cd10.
Likewise, the involvement of deep vascular structures and nerve damage was evidenced, which was decided to perform postoperative radiotherapy.
1.
Postoperatively, the patient developed a seroma episode at the level of the surgical wound that was resolved without complications.
The postoperative evolution was favorable and the patient was discharged, with control of the wounds in external consultations.
