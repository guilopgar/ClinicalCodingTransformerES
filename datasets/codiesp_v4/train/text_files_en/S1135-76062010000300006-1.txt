A 20-year-old male with a history of partial seizures since the age of 6 with generalization and poor drug control (at the time of his death was on sudden and unexpected treatment with oxcarbazepine).
During his neurological control, he had been carried out imaging studies of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that had not shown remarkable alterations.
A medico-legal autopsy was performed to clarify the cause of death.
In the neuropathological study, the encephalon stands out with a weight of 1,545 grams in which there is evidence of a paired mass of 0.5 x 1 cm in the cerebral cortex of the left parietal lobe, which does not present any effect.

Histopathological examination shows an interstitial tumour with distinctive histopathological features, consisting of heterogeneous glioneuronal elements containing oligodendrocyto-like cells and floating neurons immersed in a microcystic fluid.
Immunohistochemical markers were determined for glial acid suppressor protein (GFAP) and for neuronal markers (enolase, neurofilaments and synaptophysin) which were all positive.
In view of these findings, the diagnosis of simple NDD is established.

The rest of the organs studied showed no remarkable morphological alterations (macroscopic or microscopic).
The chemical-toxicological analysis was negative for the toxics analyzed.
