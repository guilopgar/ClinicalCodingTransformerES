A 12-year-old woman reported having suffered a left facial abscess of dental origin.
The predominant clinic at the time of our evaluation was the impossibility to open the mouth.
The most significant finding in CAT and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was the absence of left parotid gland and mandibular deformity with fusion of its posterior wall to the upper jaw and subsequent mandibular apophyses displacement of the jawbone.
Given the clinical situation described above, extra-articular release of maxillomandibular ankylosis is required, extraction of affected teeth and coverage with standard mucosal flap.
In the immediate postoperative period, the buccal opening was fixed in 2 cm using a retromolar wedge.

At present, the patient maintains a 2.4 cm buccomandibular opening, which allows solid oral feeding.
The confirmation of this entity was made by pathological study that reported changes compatible with chronic osteomyelitis.
