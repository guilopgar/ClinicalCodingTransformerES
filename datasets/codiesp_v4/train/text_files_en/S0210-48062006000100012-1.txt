We report the case of a 41-year-old patient who consulted for pain and penile induration at the proximal third of a week of evolution.
The patient had a history of smoking 20 cigarettes a day, and cyst excision in both breasts.
There were no coagulation disorders or diseases of interest.
The patient reported that one week ago he complained of pain in the back of his penis at the root where he felt an indurated, mobile nodule.
Physical examination was normal except for painful external genitalia.
Doppler ultrasound showed a dorsal induration corresponding to segmental thrombosis of the superficial dorsal vein of the penis and permeable the rest of its trajectory.

The patient was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics for four weeks, with clinical improvement of pain and decreased induration.
A follow-up pelvic magnetic resonance imaging was also requested at six weeks, in which there was no evidence of injury suggestive of thrombosis or other pathology in the location of the dorsal penile vein.
