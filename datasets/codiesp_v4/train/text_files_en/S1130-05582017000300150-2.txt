An 8-year-old female patient with increased left hemimandibular volume, 5 months of evolution, rapid growth, painful.
Intraoral expansion of buccal cortical with displacement of dental organs.
Radiographically, the lesion manifests as part of the left body and mandibular ramus, but preserves the condyle and coronoid process.
Result of incisional biopsy, plexiform ameloblastoma of the mandible.
Taking into account the local aggressive clinical behavior of the lesion, block excision is performed.
A reconstruction prosthesis was placed preserving the condyle and coronoid process.
Postoperative period was uneventful.
Neurological (inferior) and motor structures are preserved.
Good oral opening and adequate facial appearance.
Three months after the initial surgery, a bone matrix mixed with bone marrow aspirate was placed in a surgical bed in an attempt to stimulate bone growth in the surgical bed, observing adequate bone neoformation to date with acceptable dental occlusion.
Good mouth opening, facial aesthetics, as well as sensitivity and motor conservation.
Five years of follow-up without complications.
