Patient with cleft lip and bilateral cleft palate.
The premaxilla was protruded and rotated to the right, and the lateral segments had collapsed.
This protrusion made lip surgery more difficult because it increased the tension of soft tissues.
1.
After taking the medication, an ECPR was designed and placed under general anesthesia.
Parents activated the device at home to achieve expansion and once a week we modified the tension of the cadets to achieve retrusion of the premaxilla.
1.
After six weeks the premaxilla had been retruded and the segments were aligned with what could be performed cheiloplasty using the Mken technique.
