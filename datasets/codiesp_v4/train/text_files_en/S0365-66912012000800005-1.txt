A 34-year-old male, diagnosed with Klinefelter's syndrome, who came to the emergency room for loss of visual acuity of the left eye (LE) for two days.
The visual acuity in right eye was 1 and 0.2 in left eye.
The anterior pole showed no alterations and the angle was open grade IV 360o slightly pigmented.
Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 34mmHg in the RE and 30mmHg in the LE.
The central corneal thickness in the RE was 516 and in the LE 520.
Fundus examination revealed a marked increase in papillary ejection fraction in both eyes with an ejection fraction of 0.8.
OI showed oval depression corresponding to a congenital optic nerve pit in the temporal sector with peripapillary thickening associated with serous macular detachment.
The study of the left macular coherence layer of the retinal nerve was performed using optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Stratus Zeis, optical thickness OCT showed a marked increase in both reals.
Computed tomography (Humphrey 24-2) showed a superior arciform defect in the right eye and a central defect in the left eye due to maculopathy.
Fluorescein angiography showed an initial hypofluorescence of the plateau.
The OCT on the macula revealed separation of the inner layers of the retina in communication with the foset and a macular neurosensory detachment without connection with it.
We also see a lamellar macular hole in the outer layers of the retina.
