A 39-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with a one-year history of proptosis in both eyes (OA), with no decrease in visual acuity (VA).
He did not have any other symptoms to highlight or any history of interest.
On physical examination, the patient had a right eye (RE) of 0.5 and left eye (LE) of 0.8.
Hertel exophthalmos was 25 mm in RE and 23 mm in LE.
Biomicroscopic and tonometric examination was normal.
The fundus examination showed papilledema in the RE.
The Farnsworth color test was normal.
In the campi study, the OI was normal, but in the OD there was an inferonasal defect, which was not a quadrantaneus mentalis.
A computed tomography (CT) was requested and reported as ectasia/thickening of the sheaths of both NO in the context of bilateral exophthalmos more marked in RE.
Once the presence of bilateral meningocele was established, it was decided to periodically observe the patient without performing any additional diagnostic-therapeutic act.
At present, 16 years later, the patient has a VA of 0.6 in RE and 0.8 in LE.
The exophthalmos and campimetries remained stable.
At the bottom of the eye, the papillary aspect has barely changed.
Continue your regular check-ups.
