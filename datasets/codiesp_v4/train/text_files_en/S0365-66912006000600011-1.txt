A 13-year-old male patient is diagnosed with poor vision.
Fetal stricture was a short child with a 133 cm height, brachymorphy and brachydactyly in all four limbs.
The patient had a corrected refractive error of -13.00 -6.50 to 1o in the right eye and -16.00-6.25 to 179o in the left eye.
This correction achieved a visual acuity of 0.4 and 0.2 respectively.
There was no monocular diplopia or intrinsic ocular motility findings.
Horizontal corneal diameter was 12.0 mm in both eyes and pachymetry was 613 and 611 mm respectively.
The anterior chamber was narrow, showing bilateral iridodonsis.
Microspheres with anterior displacement of both crystalline lenses within the posterior chamber were evidenced.
Intraocular pressure was 20 mmHg bilaterally.
Gonioscopy showed a symmetric narrow angle in both eyes grade II according to Schaffer.
Examination by corneal topography Orcan-II (Baush and Lomb CT, U.S.A.) and examination of the eye fundus showed no abnormalities.
To prevent angular closure, Nd:YAG laser iridotomy was performed in both eyes at 10 and 2 hours, respectively.
Given the stability of vision and the absence of diplopia, a conservative attitude was adopted according to the wishes of the patient's family by controlling visual acuity, intraocular pressure, photographic documentation and visual field damage.
Reviewing his family background, the patient was identified as the child in a family of eight, in which - brother-in-law and brachyda-a brother and two sisters presented spherophakia, bracchimorphia
Parents were healthy and none of the children had offspring.
