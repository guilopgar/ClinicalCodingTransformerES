This is a 45-year-old male patient with a history of hypercholesterolemia and previous history of acute coronary disease who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery with extracorporeal circulation.
Transesophageal echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 8-10%.
The patient was intubated and maintained on mechanical ventilation for 9 days in the intensive care unit (ICU).
After extubation, the patient begins with an increase in respiratory rate and oxyhemoglobin saturation values. Therefore, reintubation is performed and the definitive fixation of the oxygen catheter is removed.
Established the framework passes to cardiology.
On the eighth day of being in the plant, the patient begins with dyspnea, stridor, intense respiratory work and tachypnea, so he is transferred to the ICU again.
Acquired symptoms of upper airway obstruction, emergency fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed complex tracheal stenosis.
Cervical computed tomography (CT) showed tracheal stenosis in the proximal end of 66% to approximately 2 cm of the glotis with peritracheal fibrosis and 5 mm lumen.
1.
It was decided to perform rigid bronchoscopy to place a tracheal stent.
Rigid bronchoscopy is combined with Nd-YAG laser therapy on the lesion and subsequent mechanical resection with rigid bronchus.
After tracheal recanalization, a silicone stent is placed (Dumon 14/40), which is correctly anchored and permeable with the proximal end at about 2.5 cm from the cords, and the distal end at about 7 cm.
In the 7-day follow-up, the prosthesis is still totally permeable and the respiratory condition has been definitively resolved.
