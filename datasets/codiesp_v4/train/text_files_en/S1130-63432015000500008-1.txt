A 41-year-old woman diagnosed with RRMS since the age of 29.
Due to the lack of effectiveness of interferon-beta, it was decided to switch to natalizumab (EDSS 2) without the appearance of new sprouts during this treatment.
This drug was discontinued after two years due to positive serology CJV and after a four-month washout period (PL) without any pharmacological treatment, it was decided to initiate fingmod (EDSS 2).
Two months after the onset and after radiological stability of the disease for more than two years, three new demyelinating lesions without clinical evidence of sprout appeared in Brain Magnetic Resonance (CMR).
From then on, the disease was radiologically stable, until 28 months later, when the patient suffered a bud with an increase in the number of lesions in both semioval centers.
Despite clinical worsening after resolution of the sprout (EDSS 3), the patient continues with fingmod (30 months from the beginning to date).
Lymphopenia was evident from the beginning (300-900 cells/mmc) as regards the safety of fingmod, without its withdrawal.
