A 63-year-old woman with no relevant past medical history presented with a soft mass of 3 cm in diameter in the left parotid region with a 4-month evolution, accompanied by peripheral facial paralysis of the cervical branch of the nerve.
The tumor, mobile and painless, easily became evident with bimanual fixation and was predominantly intraoral.
The patient did not present significant palpable lymphadenopathies in the neck and the rest of the physical examination did not present particularities.
Consultation with Neurology ruled out the possibility of central facial paralysis by computed tomography of the brain.
The ultrasound of the soft tissues was reported as a solid heterogeneous mass with density of the soft tissues in the parotid region and without the presence of lymph nodes of adenomegaly range in the neck.
Needle aspiration under ultrasound guidance was reported as negative material in two opportunities.
It was then decided to perform a frozen section biopsy under general anesthesia with an intraoral approach through which the tumor was accessible by protruding under the oral mucosa near the ostium of the Stenon duct.
After impacting on the mucosa was found a lax tumor, red wine, of vascular aspect, which was removed without difficulty by the same incision, checking its continuity with the parotid tissue of normal characteristics.
Freezing biopsy revealed a lesion compatible with vascular tumor.
The mucosa was closed with separate points of polyglycolic acid and the procedure was completed.
The evolution was favorable with hospital discharge at 24 h and complete recovery of facial paralysis at 10 d postoperatively.
There is no evidence of disease after 5 years of follow-up.
The histological report revealed capillary hemangioma of the parotid gland.
