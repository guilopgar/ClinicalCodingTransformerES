In July 2015 she started treatment with Viekirax®, Exact® and Rebetol®, 1200 mg a day for 12 weeks, without any concomitant treatment.
Two weeks later she went to the doctor's office referring good tolerance.
At week 4 the viral load is already negative but the patient reports skin lesions, change of character, aggressiveness and ideas of suicide, so both the patient and the family request to suspend treatment and is referred to Psychiatry.
In December 2015, the patient came to consultation with a Psychiatric Report in which it was stated that no psychotropic drug was prescribed and that at that time there was no contraindication to start another treatment for HCV.
