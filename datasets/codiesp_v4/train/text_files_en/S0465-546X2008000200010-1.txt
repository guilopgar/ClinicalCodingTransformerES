A 48-year-old male with no history of medical interest or toxic habits, and no known allergies.
While working in a nuclear power station, it was required to discharge a truck that transported 55% hydrogen hydrate.
One of the drums accidentally fell to the ground, resulting in the discharge of emergency services 25, warning the company itself, which had watered the surface of about 3 units.
The patient actively participated in the collection of waste, without using any personal protective equipment. At the end of the task, no clothes were changed or showered.
Several hours after the accident, he began to feel reddened mouth with chelitis of the lower lip, mouth sores and diffuse abdominal pain.
She was referred to a medical service for symptomatic treatment.
Six days after the accident, the patient developed erythematous-squamous lesions on the face and arms (zones that were not covered during the accident).
She came to a hospital where a general laboratory test and simple chest and abdominal X-rays were normal, prescribing treatment with antihistamines.
Two weeks later he came to the Toxicology Unit of the Hospital Cl√≠nico de Barcelona on his own initiative due to persistent erythema-squamous lesions, abdominal discomfort and dysgeusia.
Physical examination was normal and blood and urine analysis only showed a total bilirubin of 2.5 mg/dl (VN: up to 1.2 mg/dl) with an indirect bilirubin of 2.1 mg/dl. Abdominal ultrasound study was normal.
A control was carried out after one and three months, being asymptomatic although the bilirubin persisted slightly elevated, being discharged.
