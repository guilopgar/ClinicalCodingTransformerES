The first episode of female patient was admitted at 7 months of age due to a generalized tonic-clonic crisis, without infectious process or associated fever, which was repeated with similar characteristics at 23 hours.
No focal seizure onset was observed, with sustained vital signs and normal posterior neurological and physical examination.
Parents did not report any personal history to be highlighted, attended periodic health check-ups, and their psychomotor and aesthetic development remained normal.
On admission, blood count, renal and hepatic function tests, acute phase reactants, brain ultrasound and electroencephalogram were performed, with normal results.
The observation of a conflictive socio-familial situation was carried out to search for toxic urine that were positive for cocaine in two successive samples.
The first sample showed a quantified level of cocaine metabolites in urine of 1.7 μg/ml and the second, collected a few hours later, 0.4 μg/ml (cut-off point of our laboratory at 0.3 μg).
The father is a regular cannabis smoker, but family members denied cocaine consumption at home or in their close socio-familial environment and pointed out the possibility of contact with environmental smoke in a closed place where the crises were hours before the beginning.
Under the supervision of the assistant physician since discharge, the patient has not presented seizures in the following six months and psychomotor development follows a normal course.
