We reviewed in our consultation a 40-year-old male patient with loss of visual acuity in left eye (LE) of 2 weeks duration and metamorphopsia for two years.
The best corrected visual acuity of the patient was 0.3 and in the eye fundus was observed in addition to myelin fibers in the superior temporal arch, a REM centered on the macular region producing a pseudo-acute macular image.
A marked distortion of blood vessels around the macula could be observed.
There was no evidence of VPD.
The right eye was normal.
Fluorescein angiography showed no macular edema or diffusion of macular vessels.
The patient did not report any trauma or previous pathology in that eye, so he was diagnosed with idiopathic RME and included in the waiting list for performing a pars plana resection.
One month later, the patient presented with a marked improvement in visual acuity and disappearance of metamorphopsia.
A better corrected visual acuity was observed in the unit and in the eye fundus absence of ERM, disappearance of distortion of vessels and a prepapillary VPD.
