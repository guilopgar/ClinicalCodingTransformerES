We present the case of a 20-year-old patient who comes to the School of Dentistry of Sevilla derived by his orthodontist.
Inadequate position of the left lower canine (including in horizontal position), the temporal canine was used by the orthodontist during orthodontic treatment as permanent, not considering appropriate rescue of the definitive tooth.
The patient was informed about the existence of dental inclusion and the need for extraction or at least its surveillance.
Radiological examination (orthopantomography) showed the inclusion of the left lower canine in a horizontal position under the apex of contralateral premolars and lower canines (Mupparation pattern 8).
Location of evidence of canine transmigation indicates its extraction.
If we continue to control the case, when approaching the included tooth to the chin hole, the risks of the intervention would be unnecessarily increased, as well as the inferior tooth irritation due to the nerve would occur (9 very safely).
1.
Extraction was performed through a partial Neuman incision, with discharge at left lateral level.
No discharge was performed in the fourth quadrant due to the proximity of the mental foramen, identifying and protecting the right chin nerve during the intervention.
The tooth was extracted by coronal osteotomy and double odontosection, also eliminating the pericoronary sac.
1.
Finally, the wound was sutured and analgesic treatment was prescribed during the postoperative period, without prescription (acidbuprofen 600 mg, 1 with p. / 8 hours for one week) and antibiotic (Amoxicillin 875 mg).
The stitches were removed after ten days.
The evolution was favorable without detecting any complication.
