A 42-year-old woman presented to the Maxillofacial Surgery Department of the Marqués demandibular Valde la Santander University Hospital (España), with complaints of discomfort in the right temporal joint.
The patient reported right TMJ clicks of years of evolution without further clinical accompanying symptoms.
Physical examination revealed no dentoskeletal anomalies.
The patient had a maximum painless oral opening (MAO) of 45 mm, reciprocal TMJ click (at the beginning of the opening and at the end of the closure).Laterodeviation and pterygoid process greater than 10 mm.
A panoramic radiograph was performed in which the left condylar duplication was observed.
1.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of both TMJ demonstrated the presence of anterior displacement of the disc that reduced to the opening in the right TMJ.
The morphology of the condyle stood out in the left TMJ: anteroposterior bifidity and presence of grade II joint effusion.
To complete the imaging study, a computerized tomography (CT) of both TMJs was requested, confirming the existence of anteroposterior left bifid condyle without evidence of degenerative changes.
1.
The patient was treated conservatively with a discharge splint, muscle relaxants, local heat and soft diet.
This treatment improved clinically and is currently followed in routine outpatient follow-up in our service.
