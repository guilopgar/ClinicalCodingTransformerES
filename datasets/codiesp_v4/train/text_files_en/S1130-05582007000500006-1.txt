A 67-year-old female patient was referred to the Maxillofacial Surgery Department of our hospital with a circumscribed tumor in the left parotid region.
The apexification appeared with a pasty consistency, easily displaceable, without signs of infection or skin alterations.
We did not find palpable lymph nodes in the lymph nodes of the neck.
He had no pain in the tumor area.
Intraoral examination showed no abnormalities.
The evolution time was 3 years.
The patient did not present other relevant systemic alterations.
1.
A computed tomography was requested, which showed that the tumor compromised the superficial lobe of the left parotid gland.
There is no evidence of tissue abnormalities.
Given the clinical presentation, the presumptive diagnosis is a salivary gland tumour.
1.
Under general anesthesia and through an extraoral approach, the tumor was removed, performing superficial lobectomy of the parotid gland with preservation of the facial nerve.
1.
The pathology confirmed the diagnosis of myoepithelioma.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed typical markers for clear myoepithelial cells: actin, S-100 protein and vimentin.8
The postoperative course was uneventful.
There is only evidence of paresis of the perioral muscles on the operated side, which remits completely at 3 months.
After one year of follow-up no signs of recurrence were detected.
