A 28-year-old woman was admitted for abdominal tumor and constitutional syndrome.
She complained of usual left vacuum discomfort that increased in intensity weeks before admission.
Physical examination revealed a mobile and painful tumor in the left hypochondrium.
No data of interest were observed.
Abdominal ultrasound and CT showed the presence of a solid, heterogeneous tumor, approximately 8 cm in diameter, located in the tail of pancreas with a well-defined contour, multiple cystic areas and calcifications inside.
She underwent surgery and underwent distal pancreatectomy with solid tumor excision of 8 cm in diameter in close contact with the posterior face of the tail of the pancreas.
Pathological anatomy was reported as solid-cystic papillary epithelial neoplasia of the pancreas.
The postoperative evolution was favorable, and 14 years after the surgery the patient lives a normal life and the controls did not present alterations.
