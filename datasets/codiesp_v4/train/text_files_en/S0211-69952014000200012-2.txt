A 50-year-old Caucasian woman with CRF secondary to polycystic kidney disease started hemodialysis in 1987 and received her first kidney transplant from a cadaveric donor in 1988.
As complications of the transplant presented an acute rejection treated with shocks of steroids, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and monoclonal antibody anti CD3 (OKT3), returning to hemodialysis in June 2009 due to renal graft loss.
Hepatitis «non-A, non-B» was diagnosed in 1987 in relation to polytransfusion of blood products, subsequently confirmed positive HCV-RNA (type 1a).
In November 2009, five months after the return to dialysis, treatment was started with pegylated IFN α2a, 135 μg weekly, and RBV 200 mg every 48 hours, with the support of oscillating erythropoietin throughout.
In February 2010, she began with fever and hematuria, so the dose of antiviral treatment was reduced and renal graft embolization was performed when acute rejection of the non-functioning graft was suspected.
Treatment with IFN and RBV was resumed at the initial dose, which had to be suspended at week 40 by the appearance of exudative erythema multiforme with no response to corticoid treatment.
The patient had a rapid viral response with undetectable load in the fourth week of treatment and subsequent SVR.
In July 2011, he received his second kidney transplant from a cadaver donor.
Currently, renal function is normal and viral load is negative.
