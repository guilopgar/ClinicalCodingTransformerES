A 30-year-old woman smokes about six cigarettes a day, with a history of abortion two and a half years before being studied in the infertility service.
In this context, and during the course of vaginal ultrasound, an intravesical exophytic lesion of approximately 24 mm in diameter was observed, located in the right lateral wall, with tabications inside.

The patient was referred to the Urology Department with complaints of mental discomfort associated with menstruation, without hematuria or other accompanying manifestations.
Blood analysis showed normal values, while elemental urine only showed the presence of 18 proteins/mcL.
Intravenous urography was requested, but no other significant findings were observed. Cystoscopy was also performed, which revealed an exophytic lesion of approximately one endoscopic field, located in the bladder bottom, and a pseudocystic surface.
Transurethral resection of the described lesion was indicated, achieving complete recovery, with good postoperative outcome.
The result of the histopathological study revealed a bladder wall due to hyperplastic focal endothelium. There was a predominance of glandular tissue with less bladder morphology and endocervical components associated with bladder emptying.

After one year of follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and there was no evidence of endoscopic recurrence in the reviews.
