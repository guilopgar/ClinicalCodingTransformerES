A 38-year-old patient diagnosed with corticosteroid-dependent ulcerative pancolitis since 2004.
That same year, the patient presented inflammatory bowel activity with bloodless diarrhea, significant impairment of the general condition and weight loss of 15 kg in one month, as well as digestive intolerance to treatment with azathioprine®.
During the last 3 years, it has required several admissions due to severe sprouts of diarrhea (5-6 stools daily) with red blood.
In June 2007, the patient presented a prolonged sprout of ulcerative colitis with moderate-severe activation and poor response to pharmacological treatment with criteria of corirrefracty, at which time cytokeratosis was initiated every 5 weeks.
The access routes were the antecubital veins of the arms, and during the sessions there were no complications or adverse reactions.
Since the second session she presented a significant clinical improvement and currently receives oral treatment of mycophenolate mofetil (CellCe®).
