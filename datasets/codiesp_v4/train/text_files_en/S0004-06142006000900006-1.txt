We report a case with complex lithiasic pathology in which the 'stone sweeper' was used as an internal urinary diversion bilaterally.
This is a 54-year-old male patient with 3 renal lithiasis, the largest of them 1.2 cm to the ureteral catheter located in the inferior ileum. He also presented moderate dilatation of the right foot and neck to the sww ureteral unit.
On the left side, a 1 cm lithiasis was observed in the lower pole, which was treated with ESWL before, with partial fragmentation of the catheter. In this second renal unit, the catheter was also sweeping.
The caliber of this catheter is 6.5 Fr and maintained for one month.
1.
During the permanence of the two "stone sweeper" catheters, the patient reported no symptoms related to the lower or upper urinary tract indicating good tolerance.
The extraction of these fragments was easy, without requiring anesthesia and observing small stone fragments within the cesspits.
