We report the case of an eight-month-old patient admitted for a seven-day history of fever up to 40oC, refusal to eat and vomiting.
She had no family or personal pathological history of interest or known allergies.
Physical examination revealed only small laterocervical rye adenopathies and pharyngeal hyperemia.
In the requested study gas, he had a complete blood count with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate; C-reactive protein, 4.48 mg/dl; and normal sodium, potassium, chlorine, magnesium, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), bilirubin,
Blood, urine and stool cultures were negative and parainfuenzavirus 3 was isolated from the pharyngeal smear.
An analytical finding that called attention was an AF number of 5252 IU/l.
Parents were asked again in search of any cause of this elevation of AF, with special insistence in the consumption of drugs, history of fractures or previous diseases, both in the patient and in their relatives, without obtaining new data.
A new determination of FA was requested to verify that it was not a laboratory error, as well as GGT, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and isoenzymes of FA.
This analysis confirmed the elevation of FA (6070 IU/l), resulting the rest of the parameters requested (GGT, isoenzymes of FA, vitamin D and PTH) normal.
On the seventh day of admission, once the feverish process was triggered, the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of Parainfuenzavirus 3 infection and hyperphosphatemia under study.
It was clinically controlled and with periodic determinations of AF in outpatient clinics.
In subsequent controls, the patient presented a progressive decrease in benign AF, asymptomatic and with a rigorous normal physical examination. The patient was discharged after six months, after presenting two determinations of transient AF with normal levels for his age.
