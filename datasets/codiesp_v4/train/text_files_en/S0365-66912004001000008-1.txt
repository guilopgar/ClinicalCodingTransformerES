A 33-year-old woman referred to the Ocular Pathway Unit for evaluation of a pigmented lesion in the iris of eyebrows (OD) was referred for routine examination.
The examination showed a mean myopia in both eyes with a visual acuity of 0.8.
The left eye showed no pathological findings, while in the right eye a rounded pigmented mass of approximately 3-4 mm in diameter was observed in the superoexterne quadrant of the anterior chamber (AC) between 9 and 11.
The mass presented a regular surface area that did not include the iris.
IOP was normal, and gonioscopy showed occupation of the angle by the mass without satellite lesions.
Mydriasis examination revealed that it originated in the ciliary body, producing a musca in the clear crystalline lens and a eye fundus without evaluable pathology.
Computed Axial Tomography (CAT) showed the existence of a rounded mass located between the iris root and ciliary body with moderate contrast uptake, 8.3 mm in height and no extracular signs.
The diagnosis of probable ciliary body neoplasia was made, and the patient was asymptomatic and with good visual function. Periodic observation was decided.
The patient remained stable for 36 months until tumor mass resistant with an episode of corneal erosion due to the use of contact lenses, developed an inflammatory condition in AC, with the presence of pigment, and medical expansion IP.
The patient was diagnosed with glaucoma and surgical treatment was decided.
«External ab» iridocyclectomy was performed with excision of the tumor mass.
The patient has evolved favorably and after one year maintains a VA of 0.3.
The histopathological study showed a pigmented mass of 9x8x8 mm, with an extensive necrotic central area, and the rest composed of densely pigmented cells, polyhedral necrosis, with round nucleus.
Pathogenic cells were not found.
