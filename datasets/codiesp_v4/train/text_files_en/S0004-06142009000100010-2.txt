A 43-year-old woman, housewife, allergic to contrast agent and smoker of 1 daily pack of cigarettes, hysterectomized and right opherectomized due to endometriosis.
The patient is being studied by the Hematology Service by isolated leukocytosis; an abdominal ultrasound was performed finding a left kidney destructured with cystic images or hydronephrosis and being referred to our consultations.
During the interview, the patient was admitted for 27 days, when he was 12 years old, to another hospital due to low back pain with hematuria without knowing his diagnosis.
He also reported occasional mechanical low back pain with moderate asthenia.
Physical location: no findings
Complementary tests: blood count with mild leukocytosis without deviation of leukocyte formula being the rest normal, biochemical and coagulation normal.
MAG-3-Tc-99m renogram: normal right kidney.
Heterogeneous uptake in left kidney with superior calic dilation, retention in upper left pole presenting an excretory slowing of the curve whose activity disappears in late images.
Non-contrast CT: left upper polar cystic mass of approximately 12 cm in maximum diameter displacing pancreas and spleen.
Internally constituted by multiple cysts of different sizes and presents heterogeneous internal partitions, some of them thick and irregular suggestive of multinodular cystic nephroma or cystic renal cell carcinoma.
It was decided to perform nephrectomy with left lymphadenectomy.
In the pathological study of the specimen is reported as a kidney with a multicystic tumor of 9x10 cm occupying most of the kidney.
The cyst content is amberian without presence of solid parts or tumor adherence in the capsule.
The cavities are lined with a simple epithelium with the presence of frequent cells with "tachuela" morphology.
The intercellular stroma is fibrous.
Well-defined lesion of the preserved renal parenchyma.
Anatomopathological diagnosis of multilocular cystic tumor of kidney.
