A 65-year-old male with a history of two sessions of photodynamic therapy with Verteporfin (PDT) and proposed for a third visit for evaluation.
His current visual acuity is 0.7 in right eye (OD).
This is a unique eye, since the left eye (LE) is in ptisis bulbi due to a traumatic history occurred in childhood.
The patient reported no changes since the onset of symptoms and had not noticed any variation in visual acuity before undergoing PDT sessions.
Funduscopic imaging revealed an elevated vitelliform lesion in the foveal area with dural drooling in the posterior pole.
Fluorescein angiography (FFA) showed progressive and intense ring hyperfluorescence in late times with a central hypofluorescent zone.
Indocyanine green angiography (IVA) showed no changes of interest.
OCT shows the presence of a cuneiform structure of medium-high reflectivity between the pigmented epithelium and the neurosensory retina with a detachment of the neurosensory retina bordering the lesion.
An electrooculogram was performed and the result was within normal limits.
The patient was diagnosed with DFVA and it was decided to perform periodic controls.
In controls at 3, 6 and 12 months, the results of the tests showed no variation with respect to the first visit and their visual acuity remained stable.
In the control of 24 months his visual acuity is 0.02.
A vitelliform lesion is not observed in the eye fundus, but a rounded lesion in the foveal area is observed.
Both AGF and AVI show intense hypofluorescence maintained throughout angiographic time.
OCT showed normal foveal depression with absence of the mass of mean reflectivity observed at the first visit and increased reflectivity after the height of the pigmented-choriocapilary epithelium complex.
