A 3-year-old male who was being studied by neurologists for suspected neurofibromatosis type 1 because he met at least one major diagnostic criterion (caffee with disseminated milk spots).
She had axial exophthalmos RE for 5 months.
His VA with Pigassou test was 1.
A NMR was performed and reported as well-defined, homogeneous and isodense thickening of the NO with intact meninges compatible with the diagnosis of NO glioma in its intracanalicular portion confirming the diagnosis of intracanalicular type 1.
Since there were no lagophthalmos and her VA was preserved, we opted for revisions every 3 months during the first year, and controls every 6 months during the second year.
Although the criteria for progression of optic gliomas are not universally defined, in this case 4 years after diagnosis, both VA and radiological size of the lesion remain stable every year, so we do not propose chemotherapy treatment every year.
