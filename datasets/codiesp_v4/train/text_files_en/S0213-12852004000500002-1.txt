A 57-year-old man, with no relevant medical history, presented an asymptomatic tumor of nine years of evolution at the level of the left jugular mucosa, affecting the edentulous area of the second upper molar.
The growth of the lesion was slow and there were no ulcerations at any time.
The intraoral examination showed a nodular and well-defined exophytic mass with a diameter of 2 x 2 cm located in the middle third of the left jugular mucosa. This mass contained a solid pink caruncle of solid duct.
After provoking saliva outflow through manipulation maneuvers of the left parotid gland, we found that the duct was permeable and saliva was clean and fluid.

The treatment consisted in locating and channeling the Estenon duct through its caruncle, through a pediatric intravenous catheter, followed by biopsy-removal of the tumor mass with a cold caruncle draining the duct.
Then, we left an active intraoral drainage through the caruncle for one week and applied external pressure on the parotid gland every 48 hours.

Histopathological examination showed fibrosocolagenized tissue oriented in bundles in all planes of space, without atypia and lined by stratified flat epithelium, compatible with fibrous hyperplasia

One month after surgery, the patient's upper jaw was rehabilitated with a removable metal-resin prosthesis.
After one year of evolution, no recurrences have appeared and drainage of the left parotid gland is normal.
