A 65-year-old man presented with mediastinitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
After aortic reconstruction surgery with Da prosthesis, the patient was exposed to it 12 days after the intervention, with a high risk of spreading the local infection and possibility of rupture by drying.
Since the surgical wound was opened, patients were washed with saline every 8 hours and cured with argentic Sulfadiacin.
The patient required continuous intubation from the day of the intervention, maintaining hemodynamic stability due to the use of vasoactive drugs.
It was decided to restore the chest wall with pectoral muscle flaps.
After curettage of the sternum in the midline, a window was created at the upper end of the sternum (left margin), at the level of the ribs 3a and 4a, to involve the left aortic prosthesis.
The right pectoral muscle advanced over the sternum after performing new osteosyntesis with wires and then direct closure of the cutaneous flaps.
The patient was discharged to the ICU for 2 days with antibiotic treatment.
Two years later, the patient remains asymptomatic.
