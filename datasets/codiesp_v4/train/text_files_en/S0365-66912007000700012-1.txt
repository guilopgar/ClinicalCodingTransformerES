A 32-year-old man came to the Emergency Department due to a recent decrease in vision in OD, with the appearance of a pareca lesion in that eye.
Among the pathological antecedents, penetrating trauma in the right eye three years before was sutured in our center stands out.
The examination showed a visual acuity of 0.1 which improved to 0.5 with stenopeic.
The anterior crystalline lens biomic respected shows a cyst occupying half of the anterior chamber, whose anterior wall contacts the corneal endothelium, a 6 mm linear scar that the visual axis.
Intraocular pressure (IOP) is 14 mmHg in both eyes.
The eye fundus where it allows exploring the lesion is normal, as well as B-mode ocular ultrasound of the posterior segment.
The image obtained by Stratus OCT showed an anterior wall in contact with corneal endothelium and clear content of the cyst.
The lesion was clinically diagnosed as an iris epithelial cyst.
The patient was operated by puncture cyst aspiration with a 30g needle, cyst viscodissection to separate it from the corneal endothelium and anterior chamber reforming followed by external ab-photocoagulation with non-refluent tissue in the same surgical act.
No intense burns were performed and no confluent treatment was applied to avoid extensive iris accumulation.
The postoperative course was moderate intraocular inflammation that responded to topical corticosteroids on time and formation of a wide posterior synechiae at 12 h without developing cataract and with significant visual improvement.
Six months after surgery visual acuity was 0.8 and biomicroscopic examination showed an oval pupil vertically with posterior synechiae of X to II h as the only sequel.
There are no signs of lesion recurrence.
