A 58-year-old man presented with sudden loss of vision in his left eye.
The patient was being followed up by Internal Medicine and Palliative Care for 12 years.
His BCVA in the RE was 0.6 and in the LE 0.4.
No changes were found in IOP or anterior pole BMC.
Examination of the FO revealed bilateral EA.
In the RE, there was an elevated gliotic-glandular lesion and, in the LE, an abundant triad pigmented lesion, slightly aux-en-you surrounded by a subretinal hemorrhage in the macular area.
The suspicion of a membrane NVC in the sinus of a hyperfluorotic border «in a reticular pattern» led us to perform an AFG, which showed a late gliotic lesion in the right eye and an increased size in the left eye
OCT confirmed the diagnosis because it showed a slight elevation of the EPR-coriocapilar band.
1.
OI AF revealed a curious image, as the pattern dystrophy appeared as the negative on the angiographic image, i.e., the reticulum, which angiographically showed an alteration in the hypofluorescent FA-PRF level.
In this case, the same treatment as in the previous patient was established according to the protocol described above.
It reached 0.7.
Progressive OCT showed a progressive decrease in macular thickness and control GAF showed improvement.
