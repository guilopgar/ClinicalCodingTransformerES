We report the case of a 62-year-old patient who in December 2010 was operated on for a serous papillary carcinoma in the left ovary with involvement of a ganglia of the chain referral (stage IIIC).
Subsequently, she received adjuvant chemotherapy with ropivacaine and paclitaxel, finalized in June 2011.
Later, asymptomatic follow-up began until April 2013, when an increase of CA 125 of 88.4 U/ml (0-35 U/ml) was detected.
The CT scan showed an image adjacent to the colon and underwent anterior resection of the superior rectum with intraoperative biopsy of a liver lesion that confirmed the metastatic nature.
A second line treatment with platinum plus paclitaxel was established, showing an CA 125 value of 123.3 U/ml.
After a first cycle with good tolerance, we programmed the second one and during the first minutes of the infusion of dexamethasone/siloxane, the patient developed sudden dyspnea, vomiting, loss of consciousness and SBP/DBP of 70.
After corticosteroid infusion, the patient developed remission.
The Allergology Unit recommended a grading scheme with slowing infusion rate.
For this, three dissolutions were used with concentrations of 0.02, 0.2 and 2 mg/ml respectively, in addition to premedication the night before and half an hour before infusion with:
Cefuroximaxetil 125 mg Filmtabletten
In spite of this, within a few minutes she began with dyspnea, sweating and tensions of 85/60 mmHg, which forced her to stop the infusion and suggested that she did not use any saline solution again.
In September 2013, it was decided to start third line chemotherapy with trabectedin and pegylated liposomal adriamycin.
After the third cycle, the markers normalized and completed up to the sixth cycle, remaining in these moments free of disease.
