A 34-year-old man with no relevant medical history except for seborrheic dermatitis for 7 years.
The patient is diagnosed with diarrhea due to intermittent episodes, sometimes accompanied by mucus and blood, with a 6-year evolution.
Analytical, highlighting 600 eosinophils absolute; coprocultive: negative; altered stools; serpiginous ulcers biopsied are observed in the rectum;
Anatomopathological study: large intestine mucosa erosion, microcephaly and acute inflammation with abundant eosinophils and chronic inflammation with predominance of plasma cells.
The initial suspicion of ulcerative colitis, given the clinical and endoscopic findings, began treatment with 5-ASA, despite the persistence of symptoms.
For this reason a new analytical control (in which persists), coprocultives and stools (negative) and endoscopic control is performed.
The second stage showed a normal mucosa along the path. Biopsies of the right, transverse, left colon and sigmoid were taken. Histopathological analysis showed an increase in eosinophils in the lamina propria of all samples.
Persistent peripheral eosinophilic disease and the finding of an increased number of eosinophils in the biopsies were suspected and the patient was referred to internal medicine and allergy.
A gastroscopy was performed with biopsies, which showed no alterations.
With all the findings described, the patient was diagnosed with eosinophilic colitis.
