A 13-year-old girl with no relevant past medical history presented with severe vomiting and abdominal pain for five days.
The patient has a regular general condition, with no signs of coughing, diffuse abdominal pain, and no other accompanying symptoms.
During his stay he suddenly presents chest pain and neck crepitation after vomiting.
The patient was referred to the emergency department for evaluation.
The chest X-ray showed signs of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and upper chest region.
Intravenous serotherapy and antiemetics were prescribed, releasing the vomits, so he was discharged without requiring admission.
In a subsequent follow-up visit five days later, the symptoms resolved without complications.
