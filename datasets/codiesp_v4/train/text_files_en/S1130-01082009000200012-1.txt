We report the case of a 75-year-old woman with moderate Alzheimer's disease who presented with fever for three days.
Examination revealed diffuse abdominal pain and peritonitis.
A computed tomography (CT) was requested, which reported the presence of free fluid, pneumoperitoneum, and thickening of the entire colon wall with the presence of calcified feces inside.
Perforation location (image) was not visualized.
It was decided to urgently intervene the patient finding a diffuse fecal peritonitis with exit of fecalomas stony by perforation at the sigma level.
A Hartmann procedure was performed with a left hemicolectomy to find a new perforation at the splenic angle of the colon.
