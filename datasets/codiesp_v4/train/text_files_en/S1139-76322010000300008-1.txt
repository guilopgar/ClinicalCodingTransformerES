A 13-year-old male, with no relevant personal history, who came to the health center because for a few months he has noticed a left-sided lesion that does not cause any symptomatology and has not varied in size.
She suffered a possible trauma to the area two years earlier after a fall with skates.
He has a good general condition and is asymptomatic.
A prominence of approximately 1.5-2 cm of bone consistency around 3-4 cm above the left internal malleolus is established.
No local inflammation, hematoma, or pain upon palpation were observed.
There are no distal neurovascular alterations or functional impotence.
1.
A simple radiography of the affected tooth is requested, anteroposterior and lateral, where a bone lesion is visualized.
The radiological report gave the diagnosis: "The anteroposterior and lateral radiograph of the ankle shows a well-defined relief of bone loss of the cortical bone, without apparent soft tissue involvement, in the medial aspect of the distal tibia-chondroma".
1.
Since this is an asymptomatic mass and has remained stable preserving its size, it was decided to follow the evolution in the consultation and in case of possible changes to perform imaging test and / or cite it in traumatology consultations for review.
