A 72-year-old male diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma and who underwent trabeculectomy of both eyes in February 2001 with good blood pressure control.
One year later, the patient underwent cataract surgery using phaco plus 0.6 in posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation, without complications, preserving the posterior capsule and achieving visual acuity (VA).
Two years after surgery, the visual field showed progression in the right eye and an intraocular pressure of 23 mmHg. Treatment with Travatan® W, Alor was established.
One month after starting treatment, the patient reported a decrease in VA in her RE, and the examination was compatible with the development of a cystic macular edema that had reduced the VA to 0.2.
The diagnosis was confirmed by an OCT (OCT 3000, Humphrey Zeiss Instruments, Dublin, CA) which showed the existence of subretinal liquid aggregated with 21 spaces of low intensity corresponding to septa
Aller acetazolamide oral (edemox®, Chiesi wassermann, Madrid, Spain) 125 mg q 6 hours, ketorolaco
At two weeks, VA had improved to 0.6, and OCT showed normal macular thickness (213 EDNOS), with disappearance of cysts and recovery of foveal depression.
