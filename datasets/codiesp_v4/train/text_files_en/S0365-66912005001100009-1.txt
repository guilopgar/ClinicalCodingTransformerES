A 73-year-old male patient with advanced GCCA was diagnosed at our centre.
Two trabeculectomies had been performed that had failed early.
Given the stage of glaucoma and the existence of nuclear cataract, it was decided to perform a combined procedure of phacoemulsification and valve implantation.
Twenty-four hours after surgery, intraocular pressure was 48 mmHg and the anterior chamber was flattened with peripheral iridoendothelial contact.
Iridectomies were patent, ruling out the possibility of pupil blocking.
Examination of the eye fundus and ultrasound were normal, so malignant glaucoma was diagnosed.
Capsulotomy and hyaloidotomy were performed with Nd-YAG laser through the following pupil, a slight increase in anterior chamber deepening by perforating the anterior hyaloids, hours later.
Three hours after treatment, intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg and there was iridoendothelial contact.
One year after surgery, intraocular pressure (IOP) was 16 mmHg with 0.1% brinzolamide (AzoptÂ®, Laboratorios Alcon-Cusi SA, El Masnou, Barcelona).
