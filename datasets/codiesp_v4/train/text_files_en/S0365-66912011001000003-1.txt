The first case is that of a 9-year-old girl who reported blurred vision.
His visual acuity was 0.2 and 0.3 according to the Snellen optotype, respectively.
Refraction under cycloplegia was determined to rule out refractive defects, with + 0.75 in both eyes.
The rest of the exploration was normal, with a stereopsis of 60".
When delving into the anamnesis, a girl was adopted at 7 years of age.
While she was in the consultation room, she was managed without difficulty, even if she had suffered from what the symptoms seemed to be "property" and "self" a simulation.
The mirror test was used, and line 0.4 was seen with both eyes.
Considering that flat mirrors have the property of doubling distances, their real acuity would correspond to 0.8.
The case was discussed with the parents and it was decided to perform periodic reviews.
His visual acuity improved to the unit with both eyes at 3 months.
