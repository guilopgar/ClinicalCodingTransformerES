A 63-year-old patient reported visual acuity (VA) deficit in the right eye (OD) for several months.
His personal history included post-traumatic epilepsy of ten years of evolution, hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.
She was under treatment with 1.5 g of vigabatrin and 200 mg of carbamazepine daily since the trauma.
The VA was 0.3 in RE and 0.8 in left eye with correction.
The anterior biomycosis was normal.
In the ophthalmoscopy highlights the authenticity of both papillae and macular epiretinal membrane in the RE.

Humphrey 30/2 white-white and blue-yellow perimetry was performed with severe concentric campimetry reductions in both eyes (Humphrey Zeis, model 745).
1.
She had no family history of interest, so an inherited optic neuropathy was ruled out.
The anamnesis and analytical determinations of mean corpuscular volume, vitamins B1, B6, B12 and folic acid ruled out the nutritional etiology.
The diagnosis of vigabattrin toxicity was established and referred to the neurology service.
After one year of follow-up the loss of visual field and VA persisted.
