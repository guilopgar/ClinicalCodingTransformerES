A 73-year-old woman was admitted for elective surgery for gastric adenocarcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, performing a subtotal gastrectomy with reconstruction by gastrojejunostomy Y Roux.
As a previous history there was a probable allergy to vitamin B (NeuromadeÂ®).
Postoperatively, she presented a gastrojejunal anastomosis managed conservatively, with cutaneous exteriorization secondary to parenteral nutrition (PTN) administration without thiamine.
One month later, the patient presented neurological deterioration consisting of disorientation, bipsychia, tendency to sleep, and horizontal dysparemia that occurred during admission to the intensive care unit.
This was negative and thiamine was administered under control, with complete recovery of the clinical picture.
