An 84-year-old woman diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to the emergency room for pain and abdominal distension.
Medical treatment was initially established with the diagnosis of suboptimal ileus.
Without any urological history, he began a few hours after urethral catheterization with hematuria, which became very intense, progressing to the formation of a large bladder clot occupying the entire cavity, observing gas in the CT scan.
Urgent surgical intervention was performed, observing a bladder wall and ileus of 1.5 cm length up to 10 cm of the ileocecal valve, with edematous violet appearance, which recovered with a small perictirenal cyst.
In the immediate postoperative period, after anuria and severe hemodynamic change, the patient died (09/05/2000).
Anatomopathological diagnosis revealed that all bladder biopsies performed had vascular and interstitial amyloid deposits (AA).
