A triad assisted PPV was performed on a patient who presented a lens quadrant luxation to the vitreous cavity with secondary macular edema in her left eye (LE).
After phacofragmentation, a marked macular edema was observed when the internal limiting membrane was peeled.
Due to the aforementioned edema, 5 mg/0.1 ml triammal acetonide (Ton depotÂ® Bristol-Myers Squibb SL, Anagni Frosinone, Italy) was added to the dressing.
After a good immediate postoperative evolution, the patient came to the clinic four days later with painless visual loss (VA) and foreign body sensation in the left eye.
The VA was less than 0.05, presenting a 3.4 mm hypopion formed by the deposit of crystalline opacities without inflammatory signs, intraocular pressure of 10 mmHg and well-positioned anterior chamber lens.
A marked vitreous turbidity was observed at the bottom of the eye.
The patient's clinical picture suggested infectious endophthalmitis or pseudoendophthalmitis.
It was decided to control each Polyophthalmos with the absence of inflammatory signs, except for a large pseudohypopion, its crystalline nature and that the patient had an anterior chamber lens oriented towards coliform.
Four days later, the patient was asymptomatic, with bullae in the corneal epithelium and a 4.3 mm hypopion. After no improvement of the corneal epithelium was observed, surgical cleaning of the anterior chamber with serum was performed seven days later.
Three months later the patient was asymptomatic, her best corrected visual acuity was 0.3, and the cornea was clear without remnants of anterior chamber triad.
