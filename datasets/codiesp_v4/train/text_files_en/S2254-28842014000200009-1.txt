Due to the added neurological symptom, the patient was admitted to hospital for study.
When presenting the patient with thrombotic microangiopathy and seizures, plasmapheresis is requested from this service.
Due to the clinical worsening of the patient, she was admitted to the ICU.
Plasmapheresis session plan:
The replacement volume should be 1-1.5 times the plasma volume.
Treatment should be continued for up to 48 h after the response has been obtained.
The patient weighs 75 kgr., and according to relationship tables, it corresponds to a total of 3,500 cc. of volume to be reinfused, for which dialysis is programmed: 1,400 cc. peritoneal dialysis 20%.
Impact of meetings:
To perform the first plasmapheresis in the ICU, an attempt is made to implant a right jugular catheter, but due to its difficulty and excessive bleeding, a double-lumen catheter is placed in the left femoral artery.
The monitor used for the technique was a PRISMA CRRT-TPE (HospalÂ®), with PTE-2000 filter.
The dose of heparin was 15-5-5 mgr, with the duration of the sessions of approximately 210 minutes, with an average infusion of 980 ml/h, blood flows between 120-140 ml/min and 85 mmHg PPV-155.y
