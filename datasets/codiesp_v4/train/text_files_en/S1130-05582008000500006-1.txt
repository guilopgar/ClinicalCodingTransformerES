A 24-year-old female patient is presented who consults the Maxillofacial Surgery Service of the San José Hospital Complex in 2006, derived from the intralesional treatment of non-oral increase in volume of the same center with corticoid diagnosis.
The patient reports that this increase in volume in the lower lip dates back to 2004, which was biopsied in the same year and histopathologically diagnosed as a QG associated with a SMR.
Initial treatment consisted of intralesional consolidations performed in the dermatology service with betamethasone 4 mg and prednisone 0.5 mg, with no positive results.
In her history she reported morbid history of epilepsy in treatment, mild mental retardation, hypothyroidism, insulin resistance and iodine allergy.
The drugs commonly used are methotrexate 100 mg 1 comp/day, carbamazepine 200 mg 1.5 comp/day, metformin 850 mg 1 comp/day.
On physical examination there is a large increase in volume of the lower lip which is everted, associated with a depapilated tongue and presence of transverse grooves on the dorsum of the tongue compatible with cleft tongue as well as a discrete macrog

Treatment consisted of intralesional tapering of the lower lip in 1 ml of control 2% Kena® with a tapered tapered tapered tapered tapered to the acetonide in 1 ml of
The patient was monitored for three months in which a marked reduction in the size of the lower lip was achieved, but without achieving an aesthetic size, so a fourth non-observed improvement was performed.
Then a cheiloplasty of lower lip reduction under general anesthesia was programmed to improve the patient's lip aesthetics, with good results that were controlled one month after surgery.
