We report the case of a 27-year-old woman who was seen in the emergency department complaining of metamorphopsias in her right eye.
His VA was 0.6 in the RE and 1.0 in the LE. Upon funduscopic examination, he had several white foci of a roundish pigmentation in the left eye, a peri-retinal membrane suspicious in the posterior pole of both.
No inflammatory signs were found in the anterior chamber or vitreous.
1.
In the FFA (fluorescein angiography), a very early fluorescence blockade was observed in all foci, which rapidly passed overlooked membrane associated with NVS, with a more marked focus on phases.
A small area of central block persisted in some foci.
In the VIA (angiography with indocyanine green) fluorescence blockade was observed from early phases and throughout the angiogram, except in the case of suspected spot of hot flux ventriculomegaly in the early phases, where a hyperfluorescent sinus was observed.
1.
Both AGF and AVI showed more activity foci than those observed in the eye fundus.
A complete blood study including biochemistry and blood bank was performed. A study of HLA (B7 and DR2: for PHOS and AMPPE, A29 for Birdshot was requested to rule out tuberculosis, which was normal.
Corticosteroid therapy was started at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day.
VA improved to 0.8 and remained stable until the last follow-up visit.
The foci evolved progressively towards pigmentation.
