A 47-year-old man with no relevant past medical history of headache and occasionally vomiting in the last four years presented with nonspecific visual disturbance.
Neurological examination was normal, except for the detection of a right lower quadrant discomfort in the campimetric study.
There were no malformations or anomalies associated with or outside the central nervous system.
Computed tomography (CT) was normal.
A study with MRI was performed, which showed, in T1 sequences of compatible diagnosis for left-sided cancer, two hypersignal foci located in the cistern upper lip and upper lip.
No surgical intervention was performed, but the patient presented identical symptoms two years later.
