A 75-year-old male who had previously received intravesical treatment with MMC and BCG.
After tumor recurrence, treatment with intravesical gemcitabine was started.
During the first instillation, the patient presented intense local burning, dizziness and profuse sweating (grade 2)5, which forced to stop the treatment.
Although the patient developed post-instillation hypotension (90/60 mmHg), blood pressure levels returned to normal (130/80 mmHg) within minutes with postural measurements.
Dysuria improved during the next 24 hours with anticholinergic medication.
Urinocultiva was negative.
The treatment was suspended by the patient's decision.
After two weeks she started an intravesical treatment with MMC with good tolerance after four instillations.
