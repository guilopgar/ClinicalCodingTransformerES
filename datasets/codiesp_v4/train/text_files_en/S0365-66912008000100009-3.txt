A 43-year-old woman with pain in her left eye and photophobia.
Scopinaro's intervention was instituted one year later, following a postoperative course with anemia, varices in lower extremities, hypocalcemia and seronegative gotritis.
OI examination revealed marginal abscess, diffuse epitheliopathy and conjunctival keratinization.
VA was 0.6 in RE and 0.3 in LE.
Conclusions: After successful closure of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with bladder cancer, a topical quinolone (Chibroxín®, S.A., Barcelona, Spain) is needed.
Pituitary psyllicarpine oral (Sirmer®, Novartis SA, Barcelona, Spain) 5 mg every 6 hours, without modification of Schirmer's test (2-3 mm in RE and 5 mm in LE).
Percutaneous implantation of conjunctival keratinization and diffuse epitheliopathy was autologous serum 20%.
In three weeks, the tear film increased (Schirmer 5 mm in RE and 7 mm in LE) remitting conjunctival hyperkeratinization, with a final VA of 8/10 in BE.
