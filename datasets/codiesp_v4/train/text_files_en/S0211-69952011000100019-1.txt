A 47-year-old woman with a history of glycogen storage disease type V (McArdle's disease), Chi-square, chronic non-affiliated renal failure, urticaria and hypertension.
Peritoneal catheter was implanted on May 19, 2000, at another center, and dialysis was started with a booster infusion every 15 days later.
From the beginning, the patient experienced abdominal discomfort, pleuritic pain in the right hemithorax and dyspnea.
A chest X-ray showed hydrothorax, which led to the suspension of PD and referral to our hospital.

Pleural effusion drainage (transudate) was performed in our center with normal chest X-ray.
A new attempt was made to perform PD with a lower infusion volume and the pleural effusion reappeared soon.
Subsequently, an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) puncture complicated with extravasation and myositis was attempted.
The right pleural effusion appeared in several occasions with scarce quantity to perform hemodialysis or any other type of therapeutic option in order to solve the pleuroperitonal communication. Consequently, low volume automatic peritoneal dialysis (APD) was initiated with a high head.
The patient remained in APD until August 2002, when a renal transplant was performed, requiring transplantectomy for thrombosis.
It is included again in a PD programme in September 2002 and continued until it died at home in October 2003.
