A 63-year-old woman with no history of interest consulted for epigastric discomfort, non-irradiated and unrelated to food, of two months duration.
Physical examination was normal and laboratory data showed mild microcytic anemia and hypogammaglobulinemia.
Gastroscopy showed an excrecent, whitish, ulcerated lesion in its center in the second duodenal portion, friable and elastic consistency at biopsy.
Anatomopathological examination revealed a dense lymphocytic infiltrate with centrocytoid habitus that adhered to one of the glands and penetrated the epithelium.
Proliferating cell immunophenotypes were CD 20 and CD 43 positive, CD 3, CD 5 and D1 negative.
All this led to the confirmation of the presence of duodenal MALT lymphoma.
The patient was referred to the outpatient clinic where the extension study was completed and, after verifying the absence of locoregional and metastatic involvement, treatment with cyclophosphamide was initiated with good response.
