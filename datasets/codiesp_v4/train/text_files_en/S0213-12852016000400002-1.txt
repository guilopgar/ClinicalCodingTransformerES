This is a 14-month-old boy who came to the HUCA with desquamative skin lesions on his scalp and exudates in folds and perianal region.
A skin biopsy that gives a diagnosis of LCH is performed.
The condition is limited to the skin only and topical treatment is performed locally.
In subsequent revisions, localized gingivitis was diagnosed at 83.84.
1.
In order to determine whether there is a relationship with the previous cutaneous process, a corresponding biopsy of the marginal gingiva of 84 is performed with hematoxylin-eosin staining of the sample according to the standard technique for histopathological study.
At the same time, an immunohistochemical study was carried out using the specific markers CD1a (anticipated surface area) and Langerhans cell protein S-100.
The result of the pathological study determined the presence of a squamous epithelium with polynuclear cell infiltrate and eosinophils.
At the level of the chorion, nodules composed of cells of histiocytic structure with vesicular nuclei, clear, abolished, some irregularly shaped "green coffee" were evident.
1.
The immunohistochemical study showed positivity for CD1a surface antigen and S-100 protein, effectively determining the oral impact of the disease.
1.
The patient was classified as having multifocal Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
