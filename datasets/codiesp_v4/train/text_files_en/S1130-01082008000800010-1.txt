A 36-year-old male presented with chronic diarrhea and weight loss.
An analytical study was carried out, consisting of general biochemistry, blood count, TSH, immunological study, celiac profile and stools normal.
C-reactive protein was elevated.
Placement was performed until blind, which was normal and no alteration was identified in the barium intestinal transit.
Abdominal ultrasound showed a left renal mass in the upper pole of more than 4 cm in diameter, rounded, isoechoic with hypoechoic areas inside that could be compatible with necrotic areas.

The CT scan confirmed the presence of a 4.3 cm hypodense lesion limited to the kidney, without affecting perirenal fat or vascular access.
The patient was referred to the Urology Department and underwent left laparoscopic nephrectomy. Macroscopically, the patient was visualized in one of its poles, with a macroscopic capsule of significant necrosis and without other alterations.
In the cuts, a rounded, well-defined 4.8 x 4.5 cm lesion was identified at this pole, with a folding parenchyma close to the renal fold, with small millimetric cavities and a cold marker.
Delahunt and Eble type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed.
Currently the patient is asymptomatic, remitting after the intervention, the diarrheic picture for which he consulted
