In both cases, it was decided to perform surgical resection of a nodular tumor in the right epididymal tail, without performing posterior orchiectomy.
Anatomopathological examination of the surgical specimen was performed in both cases.
Macroscopic histological findings: nodular formation of 1.5 cms (case 1) and 1.2 cms (case 2) of firm consistency, whitish coloration and well defined.
Microscopically there is tumor proliferation consisting of tubular structures in which cellularity shows rounded and elongated nuclei without cytological atypia and occasionally shows adenomatous epidioid cytoplasm, all of which are compatible with adenomatous tumor.
