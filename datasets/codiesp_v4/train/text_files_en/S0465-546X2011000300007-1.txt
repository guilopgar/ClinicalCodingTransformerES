After clinical and electrocardiographic evaluation and after performing a flecainide test, a diagnosis of BS was made.
To complete the risk stratification, we also performed an electrophysiological study which showed A-H intervals of 128 msec and HV 44 msec.
A protocol of ventricular stimulation was carried out without induction of ventricular arrhythmias; therefore, together with the patient's clinical data, it was concluded that the BS was of low arrhythmic risk.
