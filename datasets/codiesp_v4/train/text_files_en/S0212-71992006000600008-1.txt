A 73-year-old woman with a personal history of bronchial asthma treated with bronchodilators on demand.
He did not report cardiovascular risk factors.
The patient came to the hospital due to bronchial hyperreactivity secondary to respiratory infection.
The anamnesis revealed oppressive dorsal pain with sweating and dyspnea for 8 months, which had been triggered by moderate exertion, which ceased with rest and which had not changed throughout this time.
Upon cardiac auscultation, the patient presented with a third heart sound, a fluctuating systolic and diastolic murmur, and signs of heart failure.
Pulmonary auscultation revealed the presence of snoring and wheezing consistent with bronchial hyperreactivity that led to admission.
Laboratory tests showed anemia with a slight increase in acute phase reactants.
Cardiac biomarkers were negative.
The ECG was normal and chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, not present in a previous one year.
With the initial suspicion of bronchial hyperreactivity, stable angina pectoris and secondary heart failure, an echocardiogram was requested, which showed a 4 x 5 cm mass that was dependent on the left atrium and originated from the right ventricle.
Subsequently, cardiac catheterization was performed and no angiographically significant coronary lesions were observed.
With the suspicion of atrial myxoma, the patient underwent surgery and the diagnosis was confirmed by histology.
Four months after surgery the patient is asymptomatic and without recurrence data.
