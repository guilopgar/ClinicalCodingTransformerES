A 79-year-old male diagnosed with VHL disease 20 years ago, when capillary hemangiomas were found in both eyes in a review (AO).
He has seven children of whom three of them and a niet are affected by the disease.
As systemic involvement of the disease only presents renal cysts.
At present, he presents a prosthesis in his right eye (RE) due to old tractional retinal detachment (RD), and in the left eye (LE) there is a visual acuity (VA) compatible with a normal visual acuity (VA) of 0.3.
The membrane appeared after performing a cystectomy two years ago after the patient had a vitreous haemorrhage grade III and a lower traction RD.
After fixation, vitreous haemorrhage persisted and was treated with intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF (becomeizumab).
