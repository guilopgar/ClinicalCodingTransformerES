A 59-year-old Caucasian male patient presented to our department complaining of pain in the left mandibular body, as well as hypoesthesia of the lip and chin on the same side for a while.
Intraoral examination was normal.
A radiographic study by orthopantomography and CT revealed the presence of a well-defined osteolytic lesion of about 2.5 cm in diameter located at the level of the left mandibular ascending ramus.
Biopsy of the lesion was performed.
Histological examination showed an image compatible with metastatic adenocarcinoma, probably mucosecretory type.
A bone scintigraphy showed areas of hyperuptake in the left mandibular ascending ramus, left vertebral body at T12, 8th right rib and 6th right rib costochondral junction.
Abdominal CT lobule showed a large mass affecting the body and antrum, with regional lymph nodes and a nodule in the upper left lung.
A combined treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy was administered.
The patient died 2 months later.
The autopsy confirmed the gastric origin of the metastasis.
