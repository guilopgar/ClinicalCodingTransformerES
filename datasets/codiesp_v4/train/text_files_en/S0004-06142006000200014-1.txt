A 36-year-old male, with no personal history of interest, who in ultrasound performed for colic-like pain on the right renal fossa, was reported as an intrarenal mass of 8-10 cm, complicated with echogenic cyst inside.
In a CT performed later, it was reported as a solid mass in the lower pole of the right kidney of 10 cm of maximum diameter, which conditioned compression of its excretory pathway, without evidence of tumor thrombus in renal vein or vena cava.
A bone scan with Tc99m-MDP was performed without pathological bone accumulation.
With the data obtained a right radical nephrectomy was performed, showing as intraoperative finding a mass adhered to the lower pole of the right kidney.
(The tumor and kidney, although close to the dissection, were clearly independent).
The pathological report of the specimen was a solitary fibrous tumor.
The tumor was well delimited although not encapsulated, without affecting the kidney or renal vessels that were displaced by the large tumor mass.
The immunohistochemical study showed positivity for CD34, CD99 and Vimentin, while it was negative for Desmin, Protein S-100, and CAM5.2.

The patient underwent surgery in November 2001.
Since then, outpatient follow-up in our clinic with biannual ultrasounds and annual CT scans, without recurrences.
