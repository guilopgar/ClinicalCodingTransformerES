An 11-year-old girl diagnosed with left ankle sprain treated in Pediatric Traumatology.
He was diagnosed with CRPS of the ankle and left foot by Pediatric Rheumatology and started pharmacological treatment; since no relief was obtained, he was referred to the Pain Unit.
Two weeks later, the patient was managed pharmacologically without adequate pain relief, so it was decided to implant a lumbar epidural catheter during the operation room under general anesthesia (previous information and paterno consent).
At that time, pain relief was total, but it stopped when local anesthesia was stopped.
For this reason it was decided (previous information and consent of parents) and under general anesthesia, a posterior cord electrodepolar for stimulation of the left spinal cord or implantation in the operating room.
The system was programmed once the patient had been diagnosed with paraesthesias.
Two weeks later, we reviewed the patient who continued with good response to both pain and other symptoms, so we decided to implant an implantable and programmable pulse generator and its connection.
Currently, he continues to be treated with spinal cord stimulation with total remission.
