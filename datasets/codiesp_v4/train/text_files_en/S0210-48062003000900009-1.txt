A 75-year-old woman with a history of obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
She came to our service due to an incidental echographic finding of a renal lesion.
Ultrasound: complex cystic lesion, multiseptate, with polylobulated contours, 11 cm in diameter and with peripheral punctiform calcifications, occupying almost the entire kidney.
T.C. a non-pelvic consolidation: a left renal lesion measuring 11 x 7 cm in diameter, multiseptated and with punctiform calcifications.
Absence of retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
1.
The differential diagnosis between cystic multilocular nephroma as first choice and cystic renal cell carcinoma is discussed.
We performed an isotopic renogram with Tc-99m.
Left kidney with lower uptake and functionalism, with a central cold image that could correspond to an occupant lesion.
Role of the I.R.: 25%.
Bone scan: No abnormalities.
With the diagnostic orientation of renal lesion Bosniak III was decided surgery performing nephrectomy.
Anatomopathological report: Multilocular cystic nephroma without atypia.
