A 42-year-old woman was studied in Gastroenterology Consultations since January 2005 because she presented with low rectal bleeding at the end of the deposition, together with tenesmus and anal pain of two years duration.
The patient had no family or personal history of interest and did not follow any medical treatment routinely.
Physical examination revealed only an indurated area in the left lateral wall of the rectum on rectal examination.
A complete blood test was performed which was severely normal.
2 lesions were located on the right side of the rectum.
The differential diagnosis between inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis), stercorarean ulcer and solitary rectal ulcer syndrome was initially proposed.
Pathology showed mucosal thickening, elongation and distortion of the glands and lamina propria with a large amount of rectal collagen edema, all of which was compatible with the ulcer diagnosis of the ulcer syndrome.
Rectal anorectal mantle volume was performed, showing a slightly reduced tolerable maximum volume and a minimally extended balloon time.
