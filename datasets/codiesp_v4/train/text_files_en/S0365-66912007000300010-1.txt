A 33-year-old patient, 20-08-05, was admitted to the emergency department complaining of a bleeding cut in his neck which was performed when he fell on a dressing.
In the emergency department, an itemised trauma was observed in the right anterolateral neck region with a clean dissection that interested only superficial tissues and without apparent damage to the other structures, so it was sutured by planes.
On September 4th, 2006, the patient came to the emergency room of our hospital for wound review, reporting headache and blurred vision with the right eye.
Visual acuity without correction with the RE was 1 and with the left eye (LE) was 1.
Intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg in RE and 13 mm Hg in LE.
Ocular motility was normal except for a 3 mm thick right ptosis with good elevator function.
The pupil of the right eye measured 2.0 mm and of the left eye 4.0 mm. Examination and external neck palpation, except for trauma findings, were normal.
A cervical CT scan showed a large hematoma with internal growth that was significantly compressing the trachea, so it was decided to explore and evacuate the intrasurgical plans where a deep continuity of the vein was observed.
Five months later Horner's syndrome developed.
