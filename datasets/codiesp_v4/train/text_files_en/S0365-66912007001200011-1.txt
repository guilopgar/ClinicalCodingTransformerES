A 74-year-old male presented with recurrent painful red eye symptoms in the left eye associated with progressive loss of vision for several months.
She had no relevant systemic personal history.
Accidental exposure to a cleaning product 15 years before stands out as ophthalmic antecedents.
Examination revealed visual acuity (VA) of 8/10 in right eye (OD) and 1/10 in left eye (LE).
Biomicroscopic examination revealed an area of approximately 210o of corneal conjunctivalization affecting the visual axis in the left eye, with superficial vascularization and mixed hyperemia.
There was a limbal sector of approximately 5 hours of extension that preserved normal architecture palisadesades and an absence of dye staining.
The rest of the examination showed no relevant findings.
1.
With the clinical diagnosis of partial IL with involvement of the visual axis, a CSS of the fibrovascular tissue was performed, including the corneal surface, affecting the limbal area, respecting the sector of the nasal limbus with normal characteristics.
In the denuded area, an amniotic membrane graft (AM) was placed and sutured with the epithelium upwards and then another circular fragment of MA 15 mm in diameter was sutured to the epithelium.
During follow-up there was a progressive reepithelialization with an epithelium of corneal characteristics over the graft of AM that remained integrated under it.
Three weeks after surgery there was a regular corneal epithelial surface and a significant reduction in associated mixed hyperemia.
The VA of the left eye improved to 4/10.
No recurrences were observed after 8 months of follow-up.
