Patient of 5 years and 7 months of age, without personal or family history of interest, was admitted to our hospital on June 12, 2002 for presenting a picture of 10 days of evolution consisting of headache and diplopia to the left convergent predominance,
In the neurological examination we found a girl with the diagnosis, collaborated and environmentally friendly, who presented converging strabismus of left eye with preserved ocular motility and horizontal nystagmus to forced gaze
Blood tests, biochemistry and chest X-ray were normal.
Cranial CT and MRI showed a well-defined mass located within the right lateral ventricle at the atrium and temporal horn, of homogeneous density and 6 per 2.5 cm, with significant intravenous contrast uptake after administration.
1.
The patient underwent a transtemporal approach through the medial temporal circumvection with grossly complete removal of the tumor.
Histopathological examination showed predominantly meningothelial proliferation with a meningotheliomatous pattern and high cellularity, characterizing the tumor as atypical meningioma.
Attention was paid to the presence of high mitotic activity, which, in some area, was 2-3-mitosis in 10 large increases, with proliferating cells more nuclei, showing prominent proliferating fields and proliferating areas.
The activity of the antibody Ki-67, measured at random in the entire tumor, ranged around 18-20%.
1.
The clinical evolution of the child was favorable, being discharged ten days after surgery with minimal convergent strabismus of right eye.
Although the patient has not been treated conservatively, he is currently asymptomatic and there are no signs of recurrence in control imaging studies.
