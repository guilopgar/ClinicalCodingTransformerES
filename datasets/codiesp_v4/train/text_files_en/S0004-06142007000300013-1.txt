We report the case of a 28-year-old male, with no personal history of interest, who came to the clinic for presenting for about 10 days, an indurated penis area near the balanopreputial groove.
In the anamnesis, the only data of interest was the increase in sexual activity in the days prior to the appearance of the lesion, without these relationships having been with a risk partner or having received any trauma in the referred area.
Nor did she report any micturition symptoms or fever.
Inflammatory physical examination revealed an indurated subcutaneous cord measuring about 2 cm in length, close to the balanopreputial, mobile and painless groove, with no changes associated with penile skin signs.
Inguinal lymphadenopathy was not observed.
Among the complementary tests, urine and sediment, urine culture, prostatic secretion and post-massage urine tests were performed. These tests were strictly normal, as were serology tests for venereal diseases.
Expectant management was maintained and sexual abstinence was recommended, with spontaneous remission at 4 weeks.
