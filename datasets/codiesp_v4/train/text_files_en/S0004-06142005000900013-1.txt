We report the case of a 29-year-old woman who underwent a pelvic ultrasound follow-up after laparoscopic tubal ligation.
A 20 mm tumor was detected in the right lateral side of the bladder, well delimited and hypoechoic.
The patient had no voiding symptoms, as reported in the subsequent interview.
1.
An intravenous urography was performed, in which no alteration of the upper urinary tract was detected.
The cystogram showed a rounded surface filling defect located in the right bladder wall.
Blood and urine tests were within normal limits.
A cystoscopy was performed on the patient, which showed the presence of a tumor like "preserved" ipsilateral mucosa, on the right lateral meatus of the bladder, immediately above and in front of the ureteral surface.
1.
With the presumptive diagnosis of bladder leiomyoma, transurethral resection of the tumor was performed.
The resected fragments had a white appearance solid and compact, similar to that of a prostitute adenoma with little bleeding.
The material obtained from the transurethral resection consisted of a proliferation of spindle cells of elongated cytoplasm, as well as the nucleus, and slightly eosinophilic.
No mitosis or atypia were observed.
Immunohistochemical study showed positivity for muscle-specific actin (DAKO, clon HHF35 ) in proliferative cells.
1.
Three months after the transurethral resection a control cystoscopy was performed, observing a raised area plate over the previous resection area, compatible with non-crusted chalcochlear cystopathy and subsequent acidomic removal.
