The third patient is a 25-month-old male, who came directly to the maxillofacial surgery emergency department because of the impossibility of a pediatrician in the area. He presented mouth closure and mouth closure, as well as rejection of the bladder.
The day before, playing in the kitchen, the child had fallen and hit his nose, so he had a erosion in the nasal root.
Established in the clinic and in this antecedent, the child was diagnosed with traumatic dislocation of the TMJ.
In our examination we observed pain in the preauricular region of both sides that worsened when closing the mouth.
However, complete closure was possible without reduction maneuvers, and occlusion was good.
Otoscopy was very painful, the "tragus sign" was positive, and the EAC was swollen presenting discrete scaling and suppuration.
Radiography of both TMJ was normal.
The patient was admitted to the ENT department after appropriate treatment.
