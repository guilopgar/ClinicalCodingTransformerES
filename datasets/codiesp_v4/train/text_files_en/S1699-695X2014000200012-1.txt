A 68-year-old male smoker of one pack a day for the past 40 years, without known drug allergies.
He is not hypertensive, diabetic, or has dyslipidemia.
Cataract surgery.
Our patient began to be studied in internal medicine one year before due to sciatica and edema in the lower limbs of a month of evolution.
In the clinical examination, two hard and painless masses were discovered incidentally in both parotid glands, reason why ultrasound of these glands and FNA of the lesions detected were requested.
His family doctor assumed both techniques (ultrasound and FNA).
• Ultrasound report: "At the level of the superficial lobe of the right parotid gland two hypoechogenic nodular lesions of solid appearance are identified, a more lateral of 32 mm and well-defined edges of the left microechoic lobe and a more superficial contour

• FNAC report:
- FNAC of the left parotid area: negative cytology for malignant cells, compatible with Warthin tumour.
- FNAC of the right parotid area: negative cytology for malignant cells, compatible with Warthin tumour.
(Bilateral).
• Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Report: "There are multiple heterogeneous nodular lesions in both parotid glands.
Some of these lesions present multicystic areas with hyperintense content, in relation to proteinaceous/heated content and all of them present intense enhancement.
Compatible with multicentric and bilateral Warthin's tumor".

The patient is waiting to be operated on by the maxillofacial surgery service of a bilateral multifocal Warthin tumor.
