A 24-year-old male with progressive abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa, with 24 hours of evolution, fever, loss of appetite and nausea without vomiting.
The pathological antecedents included colic atresia of the descending colon and small intestinal volvulus in the neonatal period, performing intestinal devolvulus and double bulging of the colon to the abdominal mucous fistula.
At 1.5 years of age, both colonic cables were released and termino-terminal anastomosis was performed, as well as prophylactic hysterectomy.
The patient was febrile in the emergency room (37.4oC).
Physical examination revealed abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant, with signs of peritoneal irritation.
Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis of 19.100/mm3 with left shift.
Abdominal computed tomography showed probable colitis of the abdominal stump: thickening of a tubular structure at the base of the cecum, some adjacent air bubbles and signs of colitis.
A burney incision was made, and a pericecal plastron was identified on a 1-cm tapered abutmenticular stump with a tapered tobacco and Mc Median washout; resection of the remnant sealant was performed.
She was treated with antibiotics-ertapenem and discharged on the fourth day without complications.
