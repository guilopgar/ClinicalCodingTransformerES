A 68-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism was admitted to the emergency room for acute pain in the left hypochondrium, with no constant traumatic history, irradiating to epigastric pain for approximately 3 hours.
Physical examination revealed hypotension and tachycardia, which persisted despite intravenous fluid administration; the abdomen was painful, predominantly in the hypochondrium and left lumbar fossa, with no signs of peritoneal irritation.
Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) were performed, demonstrating the presence of a rounded retroperitoneal tumor of approximately 10 x 12 cm in front of the upper pole of the left kidney, vascularized, with irregular contrast uptake.
With the above findings it was decided to surgically intervene in the same way mentioned suprarenal hematoma extending to the midline and the left iliac fossa and a tumor of approximately 12 cm in diameter extra left kidney encapsulated above the upper pole.
The evolution is satisfactory.
The evaluation performed later reveals the absence of hypertension and in the abdominal ultrasound no pathological findings were observed.
The biopsy describes a 10 cm diameter tumor and 457 g of reddish colored weight with peripheral margin of nodular suprarenal dissection, diagnosed in microscopic study: Pseudocyste endothelial.
