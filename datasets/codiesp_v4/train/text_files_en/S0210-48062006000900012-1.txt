A 57-year-old male.
She had a history of right nephrectomy for transitional cell carcinoma in 1991 and radical cystoprostatectomy with Bricker-type urinary diversion in 1995 (pTis No Mo, performed due to BCG carcinoma in situ).
He came to our consultation to assess the conversion of his urinary diversion to the stoma presentation and to note that his life was very limited by the external self-adhesive device.
An abdominal CAT scan was requested as a staging study, without signs of tumor activity.
Her baseline creatinine was 1.5 mg/dl. An exploratory laparoscopy was performed in May 2003, with complete dissection of the pelvis, identifying the urethral stump with a Benich.
The urethral stump was resected and an intra-operative biopsy ruled out tumoral lesions.
The neobladder (Studer) was constructed after exteriorizing 45 cm of terminal ileum through the stoma orifice.
Urethral-neobladder anastomosis was performed laparoscopically.
The total surgical time was 480 minutes, with an estimated blood loss of 100 cc.
The patient was discharged on the sixth postoperative day without complications.
1.
The evolution since then months has been favorable, without evidence of metabolic alterations or signs of recurrence of the basal disease.
