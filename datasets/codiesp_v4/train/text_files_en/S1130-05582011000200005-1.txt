A 57-year-old woman, whose clinical history highlights the antecedent of paralysis of the carotid body in her sister, who was treated with surgical resection of the lesion.
He came to the service due to an increase of cervical volume on the left anterior side to the mental retardation of 5 years of evolution, slow growing, mobile in anteroposterior direction, with recent odynamism.
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a lobulated hyperdense, well-defined 29.7 Ã— 33.3 mm image located in the carotid bifurcation, with no apparent airway involvement.
Angiography shows a typical "ira" image, in which the ovoid lesion shows homogeneous contrast uptake, as well as an opening of the carotid bifurcation.

According to the clinical and imaging findings, the diagnosis of carotid body paralysis was made.
Due to the size of the lesion, selective embolization was performed with polidocanol foam and 48 hours later, under general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation, surgical resection of the lesion was performed with a carotid dissection completely anterior branches to the muscle.
The specimen obtained is sent for histopathological study, in which it is observed the presence of accumulations or nests of oval cells with uniform nuclei of classic hyperchroidal body surrounded by vascular stroma, conforming to the pattern
