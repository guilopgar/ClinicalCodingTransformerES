A 26-year-old male professional athlete (a soccer player) with no other relevant personal history for the case in question.
He suffered a fall during sports practice from his own height, supporting his left wrist and producing hyperexhibition of the wrist.
As a result of the trauma, he presents pain, deformity and functional impotence, with normal distal neurovascular exploration.
The anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the wrist show a fracture of the radial styloid apophysis, a fracture of the semilunar bone and a luxation through the fracture line of the semilusis.
The dorsal fragment of the semilunency is located united to the defective bones and dorsally displaced, while the volar fragment is in its anatomical position.
This image diagnosed a fracture-dislocation transstyloid-transemylunar.
1.
We urgently proceeded to closed reduction of the dislocation by traction and immobilization, proving the instability of the lesion.
Post-reduction computed tomography was also performed, observing that the fracture line of the semilunar bone was coronal-oblicuous and comminuted.
1.
72 hours after the procedure, and after performing a supraclavicular block, the patient underwent a dorsal approach with Berger's dorsal opening at the level of the third log and capsulotomy according to the knife technique (8).
After fixation, semilunar fracture was defined as a reduction of the semilunar ligament, with placement of a 2 mm diameter minitor and repair of the scapholunar ligament with a harpoon.
Total limb ischemia time was 74 minutes.
1.
After 6 weeks of immobilization, the patient presented with instability prior to return to rehabilitation until stabilization of the clinical picture with functional limitation: flexion 35o, extension 25, prono-supination due to lack of compliance with radiation therapy.
In the one-year review, the process is stabilized, without worsening.
