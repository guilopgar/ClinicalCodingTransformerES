This is a 71-year-old woman, with a history of interest for 25 years, diagnosed with hypertension, rheumatic polymyalgia and temporal arteritis.
In 1988 it was detected after a metrorrhagia study, an endometrial tumor, performing hysterectomy plus double adnexectomy, objectifying in the anatomopathological study that it was not a well differentiated internal lymphatic adenocarcinoma (i.e., non differentiated).
Later, she received radiotherapy with a 60-blot in the pelvis and brachytherapy in the vaginal dome.
He underwent periodic reviews without evidence of relapse.
In 2003, the patient consulted for irritative cough and mild hemoptoic expectoration, with a mass in the left upper lobe visualized in a simple chest X-ray.
With the suspicion of bronchogenic neoplasia, the studies were completed, performing a toraco-abscessive CAT scan with no other pelvic lobule, finding that 8 cm necrotic mass in LSI with alterations of this.
Bronchoscopy showed a tumor in the anterior segment of the lobe, the BAS and bronchial biopsy were compatible with poorly differentiated epidermoid carcinoma.
With the clinical diagnosis of each carcinoma Epidermoid of Pullet T2 N0 M0, it was decided to start neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the Carboplatin scheme (AUC 6200mg.2) plus Paclita2).
After three cycles of treatment, a partial response was observed in the studies and the patient underwent left upper lobectomy and lymphadenectomy.
The analysis of the surgical specimen showed a tumor corresponding to adenocarcinoma with poorly differentiated areas, with some scaly area, with positive immunohistochemical result in the expression of estrogens and progesterone, and negative for TTF-1 and CK20.
These confirmatory results changed the initial approach, not being a primary lung tumor as thought, but a pulmonary relapse of its endometrial tumor.
The patient is being treated with megestrol acetate, with good tolerance, disease-free and currently being followed up.
