A 75-year-old male presented with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
As a result of mild lower urinary tract symptoms, a pelvic right paravesical ciliated image is observed on plain abdominal radiography.
X-ray findings revealed two masses, one 3 cm in diameter and another 1.5 cm in diameter, with calcified walls, compatible with hidatid cyst in the back.
Since the beginning, the patient has been asymptomatic, so periodic CT scans have been established. On the other hand, there is a heterogeneous gap in the periphery of the patient with the passage of time. A mass above 2.5 cm of the right calcaneus persists in the pelvic cavity.
