An eight-year-old boy with diffuse intermittent abdominal discomfort in recent years, attributed to acute banal processes.
No personal or family history of interest.
No urinary infections or other urinary symptoms.
Coinciding with an episode of abdominal pain in the right hemiabdomen, an abdominal ultrasound was performed, which revealed a mild right renal pelvis dilatation with suspected stenosis.
Urine and urine collection were normal.
1.
Abdominal pain disappeared spontaneously, but she was referred to Pediatric Nephrology for follow-up.
Asymptomatic, follow-up ultrasound showed dilation of the right renal pelvis with mild dilation of the right renal pelvis; therefore, an isotope junction was requested (skin via urinary stricture).
The renogram confirmed obstructive ectasia in the right kidney.
The renal scintigraphy study showed an increase in the right renal size, with evident hypouptake throughout the medial border, signs of dilatation of the pathway, with a renal function of 58.8% in the right kidney and 41.2% in the left kidney.
Urinary tract dilatation of obstructive cause was referred to pediatric urology for surgical intervention.
A nephrostomy catheter was placed for a few months to recover and prevent deterioration of renal function5,6.
After removal of the nephrostomy catheter, imaging, clinical and analytical controls continued to be performed, progressively normalizing.
