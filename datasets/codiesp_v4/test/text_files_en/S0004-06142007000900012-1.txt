A 67-year-old woman with a personal history of hysterectomy, dyscal and hiatal hernia, tibia and fibula fracture, as well as right nephritic colic who came to the urology department for review.
In the ultrasound study, a solid neoformation is observed in the right kidney of 5 cm. CT is performed in which a mass is described at the cortical level of the right kidney, of approximately 5 cm, does not affect the perirenal space.
With the diagnosis of probable hypernephroma right radical nephrectomy was performed by laparoscopy.

The macroscopic study describes a cortical neoformation of 5 cm of maximum diameter, well-defined, but not encapsulated, that deforms the cortical hemorrhagic surface without cystic areas, with a colored appearance surface.
In the microscopic study, neoformation consists of acinar structures covered by uniform cubic cells with low cytoplasm and nuclei with uniform chromatin immersed in a slightly cellular stroma.
Immunohistochemical study was performed to determine vimentin, cytokeratin 7, broad-spectrum cytokeratin, CD34, chromogranin and EMA (Master Diagnostic.
Grenada.
Spain), generalized expression of vimentin, focal cytokeratin 7 and EMA in epithelial cells, and CD34 in stromal component.

The patient is asymptomatic 24 months after the intervention, without remarkable incidents.
