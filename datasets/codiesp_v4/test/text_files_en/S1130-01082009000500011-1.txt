A 67-year-old male patient, active smoker, with no personal history of interest, who came for endoscopic study for dysphagia to solids and liquids progressive for a year, with occasional odynophagia or fever, without weight loss.
Gastroscopy showed an irregular mucosa with a naked appearance, with circular erosions and other ulcerated areas covered with fibrin, which caused partial stenosis of the esophageal lumen.
Rest of normal examination.
1.
Six biopsies were taken from the described lesion.
Histologically, the samples correspond to thick strips of esophageal polystratified plane epithelium, partially surfed by vascular-connective axes, which preserve a normal maturational gradient and a focus of superficial exocytic cell lineage.
