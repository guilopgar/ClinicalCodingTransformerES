A 54-year-old woman came to the emergency department complaining of 5 days of progressive pain starting in the right iliac fossa, associated with hypoxia and without alterations in the intestinal transit, previous local symptoms or trauma.
His past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus treated with enalapril and acetyl salicylic acid.
On examination, the abdomen was distended, painful at the level of the right iliac fossa with no signs of peritoneal irritation.
Analytical analysis showed no alterations except for an increase in acute phase reactants (fibrogen 811 mg/dl and CRP 12 mg/dl).
Computed tomography (CT) showed a 4 x 3 x 5 cm mass adjacent to the cecal pole with an 8 mm appendix to assess acute colitis in the face of a complicated neoformative process.
Initially, a laparoscopic approach was used, finding a hematoma with mass effect at the cecum level and free bloody fluid, so it was decided to convert and perform a right hemicolectomy with an uneventful postoperative period.
Pathological anatomy was reported as an area of blood extravasation at the level of cecum subserous tissues with foci of consolidation without histological signs of malignancy.
