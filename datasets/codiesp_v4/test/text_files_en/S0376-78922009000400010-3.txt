A 7-year-old male presented with a large facial mass due to marked right facial hypoplasia.
Median NMR confirmed mandibular anchilosis accompanied by high secondary tissue retraction and microretrognathia, allowing only a maximum interincisal opening of 4 mm in addition to a class II malocclusion.
Surgical resection of the ankylotic block of the right temporomandibular joint was performed by osteotomy at the level of the condylar neck and right coronoidectomy, followed by reconstruction with chondrocostal graft.
At the time of final discharge, the patient maintained an oral opening of 3 cm.
