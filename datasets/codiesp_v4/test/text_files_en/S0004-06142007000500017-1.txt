A 67-year-old male patient, with no history of interest, came to the urology department for the first time, referred by his primary care physician for symptoms of prostatism.
Physical examination revealed an adenomatous and enlarged prostate (III/IV).
Transrectal ultrasound showed a heterogeneous parenchyma with isolated calcified right lobe without objectifying hypoechoic and prostatic 10 c images.
In the analysis, PSA elevation (13.08 ng/ml).
A transrectal prostatic biopsy is indicated.
The pathology result was reported as blue proband.
We describe a prostatic parenchyma with chronic inflammation and foreign body granulomatous reaction, with presence of intracytoplasmic granules and spindle-shaped precipitates.
There is no evidence of malignancy in any of the samples.
