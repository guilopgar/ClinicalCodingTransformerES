The first case is a 25-year-old woman diagnosed with Laur-Moon-Biell syndrome that manifests as hypogonadism with obesity, mental retardation, polydactyly renal insufficiency, pigmentary syndrome.
He started HD treatment at 11 years old, received his first kidney transplant the following year, which failed due to venous thrombosis, so he returned to HD and required transplantectomy 9 months later.
Due to difficulties in vascular access, the patient was referred for PD.
During the evolution the patient suffered several episodes of peritonitis and suffered a severe hyperparathyroidism.
Its peritoneal membrane was classified as medium-high carrier.
After 12 years in PD program, the patient shows a poor general condition and peritonitis, caused by two germs (Staphilococcus epidermis and staphylococcus Pseudomonas aeruginosa), together with tunnel infection
On examination, a "mass effect" was observed in the area of the subcutaneous tunnel, not fluctuating, without inflammatory signs, of hard consistency and contour, producing a peritoneal incisional hernia in the orifice.
Radiological images showed calcification and calcification of the entire peritoneal membrane compressing all abdominal visceral structures.
Specific antibiotic treatment was applied, PD catheter was removed, and HD was transferred.
Later, the patient had feeding difficulties due to vomiting.
Once on HD she developed two new episodes of ascites secondary to peritonitis by Echerichia coli, which required evacuation by paracentesis.
Subsequently, she presented acute ischemia in the right lower limb due to femoropopliteal obstruction.
1.
Surgical treatment of peritoneal calcification and amputation of the ischemic limb were ruled out.
The evolution was conservative, dying soon after.
