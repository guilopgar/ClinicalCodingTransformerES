The patient has a history of type B NHL grade II (Real) already treated with chemotherapy according to the CHOP-R scheme and successively with high doses of cyclophosphamide with the aim of mobilizing the cells.
A recent total body CT scan described a remission of lymphomatous disease while osteomedullary biopsy showed secondary myelodysplasia in the absence of seizures.

The microscopic analysis of CSF shows an increase in the total number of cells, consisting of a large number of neutrophils, megakaryocytes and myeloid cells with intermediate maturation; a representative picture of a medullary population.
Immunohistochemical cytological analysis was compatible with myeloid metaplasia: factor VIII and myeloperoxidase positive in morphologically compatible elements.
Repeated CSF analysis compared to peripheral blood and the fact that no spinal cord injury was traumatic or difficult to perform excludes contamination.
In the meantime, Sterotropho illtophilia is positive and sensitive to current antibiotic treatment.
