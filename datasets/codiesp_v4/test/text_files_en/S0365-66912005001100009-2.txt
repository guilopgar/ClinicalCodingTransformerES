A 76-year-old woman with GCCA was referred for surgical treatment.
After an early failed trabeculectomy, it was decided to perform a combined procedure of valve implantation and phacoemification.
Twenty-four hours after surgery the patient showed athalamia with peripheral iridoendothelial contact with an IOP of 40 mmHg.
After ruling out other possible causes of athalamia with hypertonia (choroidal detachment, annular ciliochoroidal detachment and pupillary block), the same case was diagnosed as a malignant glaucomacapotomy.
One year after surgery, IOP was 12 mmHg with thymolol maleate 0.5% (Timof® 0.5%, Merck Sharp & Dohme de España SA, Madrid) every 12 hours.
