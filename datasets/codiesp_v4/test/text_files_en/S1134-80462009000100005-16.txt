A 61-year-old male patient, who is being evaluated for the pain of grade III obliterating arteriopathy with involvement of the lower limbs.
She has received analgesic treatment Durogesic® Matrix of 50 μg/h for 18 months with acceptable pain control (VAS, 3-4).
As rescue medication is using paracetamol 1 g (maximum 1 or 2 daily).
She came to the pain unit in an emergency visit because 15 days ago she had increased pain threshold with some agitation and nervousness.
All this picture occurs as a result of going to the bedside doctor for his medication and he was prescribed transdermal fentanyl of 50 μg/h generic, requiring as rescue paracetamol 1 g every 6 h increasing the VAS with little pain relief 7 h.
After anamnesis with the patient, we prescribed Durogesic® Matrix 50 μg/h again.
When the patient is reviewed after 2 weeks, she again presents better pain relief, with a new VAS of 3-4, disappearing the nervousness state she had presented before.
Currently, 3 months after the last visit, the patient continues with Durogesic® Matrix 50 μg/h and, occasionally, paracetamol 1 g.
