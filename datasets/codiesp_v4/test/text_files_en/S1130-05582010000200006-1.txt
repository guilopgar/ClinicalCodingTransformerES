A 19-year-old female patient presented with recurrent mild pain in the left hemimandible associated with paresthesia of the mentioned area, especially in the lower lip.
It also describes mild pain when chewing molars and premolars on the affected side.
On physical examination a mild facial appearance is observed due to an increase in volume located in the posteriormost area of the mandibular body and right ascending ramus.
The swelling is painless.
An external bony table at the level of the second molar area is observed intraorally.
A similar situation, but with expansion of both tables, is researched the consolidation of the mandibular ascending ramus.
Clinically absent third molar.
With the diagnostic hypothesis of odontogenic mandibular cyst or odontogenic tumor imaging study is requested prior to biopsy.
Panoramic radiography revealed an extensive radiolucent lesion with uniloculated net limits that compromised the entire mandibular ascending ramus.
Once attached to the lesion, the molar is placed in a low position and in a molar position.

An incisional biopsy is programmed during which, according to the clinical characteristics of the lesion, a stent is placed.
Histopathological report revealed a unicystic ameloblastoma of intramural growth type IIIa of Ackermann9.

After 10 months of clinical and nucleographic follow-up, with the presence of a molar suppressive cannula whose length is gradually reduced, there is an almost total reduction of the residual cystic lesion to curettage 15. The removal involves surgery and
