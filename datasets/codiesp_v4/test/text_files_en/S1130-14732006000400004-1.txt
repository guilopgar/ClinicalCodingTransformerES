Patient was 14 years old and was admitted for treatment of cervical dyscal hernia at C4-C5.
One month before she had started to suffer right cervicobrachialgia and cervical muscle contractures, without neurological deficits.
The pain improved with conservative treatment, but days later began with difficulty in identifying the right upper limb.
Physical examination revealed loss of strength in the right deltoid and biceps (grades 2/5 and 4/5 respectively).
No malformations were detected, nor pyramidalism in the lower limbs.
Cervical spine X-rays showed loss of height in the vertebral bodies of C4-C5-C6, as well as calcification at the level of the disc C4-C5.
Cervical MRI revealed a right discal hernia C4-C5 involving the ipsilateral root.
A cervical computed tomography (CT) showed that the hernia was calcified.
A complete analytical study was carried out, not observing changes in the hemogram, in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (GSR), or in the phosphocautery metabolism.
A gammagraphy ruled out pathological uptake.

This patient had been diagnosed at the age of 10 years with idiopathic interclassifications due to a radiographic study motivated by cervical pain.
This study showed the existence of a qualification at C4-C5 level and several qualifications at dorsal level.
MRI ruled out any discal herniation.
Until the current episode, the patient had asymptomatic pain, except occasional back pain.
Given the neurological deficit presented by the patient, we opted for surgical treatment of dyscal hernia via anterolateral approach.
The existence of an interconnected disc was observed during surgery.
The opening of the posterior common vertebral ligament resulted in the exit of a white deposit material with paste, which was at moderate tension.
The pathological report of the material obtained was fibrocartilage with foci of calcification.
One month later the patient had completely recovered from her deficits.
