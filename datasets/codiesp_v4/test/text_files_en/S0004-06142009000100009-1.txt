A 44-year-old male patient, whose personal history highlights testicular trauma in childhood that did not require surgery.
It is caused by an increase in the size of the right hemiscrotum associated with mild testicular discomfort for 7 months and autopalpation of a right paratesticular mass.
Physical examination revealed a penis with no findings of interest, a left test of size, mobility and normal consistency, and an enlarged right hemiscrotum with a normal test and a structure adjacent to the upper pole not separated from the theoretical.
With a view to a first approach to diagnosis, germ tumor markers are requested, with normal results, and testicular ultrasound that describes a structure adjacent to the right test in its upper pole differentiated from the same, smaller testis and hydrographically similar.
1.
A CAT scan was also performed, which showed two structures in the right hemiscrotum of similar aspect, one of them smaller than the other, without other relevant exploratory findings.
1.
An exploratory scrototomy was performed, which showed a right hydrocele and two related structures, compatible with the test, sharing epididymis and vas deferens.
Biopsy of the smallest structure was taken and vaginal eversion was performed for hydrocele solution.
Pathological examination revealed preserved testicular tissue without signs of malignancy.
