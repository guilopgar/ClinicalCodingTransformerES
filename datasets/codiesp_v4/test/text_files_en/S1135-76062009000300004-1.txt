A 19-year-old male in a military uniform was found in the supine position with both limbs above the sides of the body, in an open night setting.
On the left forearm a weapon of manufacture and military use was identified: the Fusil body with automatic spasmolata clam - FAL, model No 50-63, supercompact with a folder and abutment.
The place of the event and the clothes of the victim were found without signs of violence.
The deceased patient had blunt tears in his oral cavity, abundant epistaxis, otorrhea and a large blood spot below his head.

After performing the protocols to fix the site of the event, the body was rotated to corroborate the existence of a supposed exit orifice in relation to the large blood spot under the wound edge, identifying a regular cervical level.
The presence of a cavity in the terrain corresponded perfectly with the skull and perforation on land in direct connection with the supposed exit orifice.
The probing of this perforation allowed the establishment of a depth of approximately 20 cm with an estimated depth of narrowing between the oral cavity and the cervical orifice, right-to-left direction, bellow-arm.
The location of the perforation is determined by the projection.

During the autopsy procedure in the morgue and given the lesions of bucco-maxillo-facial involvement, the harmful elements were described as follows:
1.
A large contuse lesion in the oral cavity with periorificial tear in both margins and a stellate shape, with marked destruction to the right side of the individual.
Pigmentation - grayish pigment deposits throughout the oral mucosal cap, most marked on the left jugular mucosa.
A large tear was identified throughout the lingual body with identical presence of the pigment.
In the most posterior and lateral left sector at the junction of the hard palate, blade and isthmus of the fauces circular perforation of 1.5 cm in diameter and intense hemorrhage was observed.
With regard to hard structures, a maxillary and mandibular fracture was observed at the junction of their respective central and lateral walls, with displacement and significant mobility of fracture cables toward the right side.
No direct or indirect dentoperiodontal lesions were found in maxillary teeth.
Regarding the mandibular teeth, the lower right central axis was intact but avulsed and displaced towards the mandibular basal line in the fracture line, while the lateral dentinal substance loss with same side evidenced fracture line.
The missing tooth fragment was identified at the depth of the line mandibular fracture, on the same side as the central avulsed fracture line.

2.
Circular perforating lesion with regular edges of 1.5 cm in diameter located in the midline slightly to the left at the posterior cervical level about 3 cm below the occipital eminence, partially hidden by the hair.
Macroscopic examination revealed the absence of metallic particles.

3.
The passive probing of the tract established the communication between the perforation described at the depth of the oral cavity, in the left posterior sector, with the orifice at the cervical level establishing a rectilinear direction slightly from right to left tongue velocities.
No metallic residues were identified in this path.
In view of the morphology odontosin of both orifices, a tongue wedge was obtained, which was fixed in 10% formaldehyde and in Cordoba, with routine technique of inclusion in paraffin and hematoxylin color.
The identification of particles caused by defecation of the powder embedded between the striated lingual muscle bundles and the absence of these in the exit orifice made it possible to confirm the oral cavity as a point of entry.
1.
Toxicological analyses were negative for both alcohol and drugs.
The absence of signs of struggle (both in the scene and in the subject's clothing), the location and number of wounds, the direction and distance of the shot and the spasm in the left hand determined the determinant medical event.
