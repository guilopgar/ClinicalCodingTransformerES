An 18-month-old girl with sickle cell anemia diagnosed at her hospital of origin with sepsis (maximum normal adrenaline 1.5 Î¼g/kg/min, mechanical ventilation 21 days, CID 2.360), started APD at 40 h.
APD was initiated on day 2 with 1.36% liquid, 10 ml/kg hourly passes, 20 minutes of stay, D/P, creatinine and D, 0.805 and effective urea ratio between 0.91, respectively.
To obtain negative net balance, we had to increase the concentration of dialysis fluid to 3.27%.
We observed that with a volume of 15 ml/kg and 10 minutes of permanence, pass time, to 3.27% the value of the ratios increased to 0.27% the value of the following ratios decreased to 0.51, 0.47 and 0.41 / 0.25 respectively.
In these circumstances the values of the D/P ratio urea, creatinine and DMARDs with glucose clearance were 1.04, 0.85 and 0.14 mg per day, respectively, so we decreased the permanence at 2 hours, 6dl.
At day 27 with 6 daily passages with 1.36% glucose at 15 ml/kg and 2 hours of permanence the ratios were 1.04, 0.92 and 0.13, leading to an increase in creatinine clearance of 1.78 mg per day and a decrease of 1.87 mg per day
