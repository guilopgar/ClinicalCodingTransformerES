In 2000, at the age of 47, a stage IIIB breast mastectomy was performed for ductal carcinoma (T4a N1).
Hormonal receptors were positive, as was Herceptest (++).
She received chemotherapy (CMF), radiotherapy and tamoxifen.
In May 2003, a cervical bone relapse was detected that caused spinal cord compromise.
She was treated with surgery and local radiotherapy.
Subsequently, treatment with letrozole was started.
In November 2003, a bone and ganglionic tumor progression (supraclavicular) was confirmed.
Palliative cytologic treatment began with epirubicin, docetaxel and trastuzumab.
In the following weeks she presented a significant but transient symptomatic worsening; the evolution of these symptoms is described in notes of the patient herself, which then made us easier.
Simultaneously, an elevation of CA153 and alkaline phosphatase 1) were found, which subsequently decreased to normalize (Graphic).
From a clinical point of view, uptake in bone scintigraphy did not undergo any relevant changes, but supraclavicular lymphadenopathy achieved a complete response.
The duration of response was ten months, after which the patient had bone and liver progression.
She is receiving a new line of chemotherapy with apparent stabilization of the disease.
