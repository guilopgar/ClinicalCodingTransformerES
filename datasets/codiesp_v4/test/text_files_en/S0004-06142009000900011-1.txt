A 53-year-old male patient presented to the urology department with a left testicular mass.
Physical examination revealed a palpable mass in the upper pole of the left testicle, which was firm and painless.
Testicular ultrasound was performed, describing an area of 2 x 2 cms, with heterogeneous echogenicity, with multiple cystic areas, suggesting possible neoplasia.
Tumor markers are negative.
High suspicion of testicular tumor, performing left radical orchiectomy.
In the histological study of the surgical specimen, a well-defined tumor of 1.8 cm in diameter, colorless and stony consistency is macroscopically described.
Microscopically, it is composed of corneal scams and nests of squamous epithelium, in which epithelial cells are recognized as "on accountable".
Most of this material is calcified and ossified around the lesion, a fibrous reaction that determines the formation of a pseudocapsule that delimits the tumor.
In this fibrous pseudocapsule smooth muscle bundles are identified focally.
Testicular parenchyma shows moderate interstitial edema.
The epididymis and the cord do not present relevant histological alterations.
The pathological diagnosis reported testicular dermoid cyst (mature testicular neoplasm), pseudopilomatrixoma variant.
1.
After orchiectomy, an extension study was performed by chest X-ray and CT scan nonpelvic except for systemic extension of the disease.
Testicular tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein, beta-HCG and LDH) are negative.
The patient is currently asymptomatic and free of disease after 6 months of follow-up.
