A 27-year-old male patient, also native to Senegal, with no previous history of interest, presented with vomiting and abdominal pain.
The patient reported asthenia and anorexia for one month, with diffuse abdominal discomfort since the onset of symptoms.
Clinical progression and vomiting appear in the emergency department.
The physical examination showed an acceptable general state of health, highlighting only a severe pain related to palpation of the epigastrium and right hypochondrium, with a swelling area compatible with a mass at this level.
There were no signs of peritoneal irritation, although there was voluntary defense.
Blood tests showed moderate hypertransaminasemia and mild coagulopathy.
Ultrasonography showed a large liver mass (about 12 cm in diameter) with numerous satellite nodules.
MRI confirmed the hypervascular nature of these lesions.
Finally, viral serology revealed chronic HBV infection and alphafetoprotein was 12,687 ng/ml, so the patient was diagnosed with giant CHC with satelitosis and HBV infection.
Palliative symptomatic treatment was established and the patient died a few months later.
