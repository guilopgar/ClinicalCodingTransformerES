We report the case of a 61-year-old man diagnosed, operated on and treated for rectal adenocarcinoma 18 months before.
It was characterized by painful swelling of the penis, together with the appearance of erythematous lesions, excrecent and bleeding on the face of the preputial skin.
Simultaneously, hypogastric, penile and scrotal lymphedema was observed on examination.

Exeresis was performed by circumcision.
The pathological study reported preputial subcutaneous metastases secondary to intestinal adenocarcinoma.
Macromicroscopically it was observed tumoral in the epithelium lining flat layer giving rise to a carcinomatous excrecy.
The low inflammatory component stood out.
A large increase is observed in malignant neoplasm as a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with high grade and high mitotic index.

Despite the oncological treatment received, the patient died 4 months after diagnosis.
