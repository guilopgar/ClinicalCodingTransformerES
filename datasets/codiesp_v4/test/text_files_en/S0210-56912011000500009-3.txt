A 57-year-old male with no relevant past medical history was admitted to the emergency department with chest pain.
An acute coronary syndrome with ST segment elevation in the anterior heart was diagnosed and percutaneous coronary angiography was performed.
The patient had a lesion in the middle portion of the anterior descending coronary artery, so angioplasty was performed and a stent was placed, without complications, after administration of 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid, 300 mg of heparin sodium and 5,000 IU of clopidogrel.
At the end of the procedure, the patient was in Killip class III and had massive vomiting.
The O2 arterial saturation was 92%, with a venue to 50% 10 bpm.
Digestive endoscopy with respiratory support was performed with CPAP-B, according to the protocol described, and a Mallory Weiss lesion was observed.
Hemoglobin fell from 15.1 to 13g/dl and hematocrit from 43.6 to 39.1%.
At the end of the procedure, the patient was 100% and CPAPB could be withdrawn (no arterial gas was used due to the risk of developing hypertension following the administration of anticoagulants for saturation and bleeding).
