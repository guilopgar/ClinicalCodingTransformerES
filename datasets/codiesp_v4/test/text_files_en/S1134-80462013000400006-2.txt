A 13-year-old girl with CRPS of the right lower limb secondary to an ankle sprain occurred six months before arrival at the Unit.
The attitude to follow was the placement in the operating room, under general anesthesia, of an octopolar electrode (Octrode) in posterior medullary cords at T9-T12 level and external electrical connection to an impulse generator.
Once the anesthesia was recovered, the system was programmed with very good location of paresthesias on the affected area.
It was reviewed later in the mobilization of the pain unit that triggered a good response to both the pain and the edema and other signs, it was reviewed a week later in which it was proved that the rehabilitation had been severe
This situation was established and, according to the parents, it was decided to connect, in the operating room and under general anesthesia, a programmable electrical impulse generator called Genesis.
It was evaluated 15 and 30 days after implantation of the generator, continuing in the same situation of pain relief and accompanying symptoms.
Six months later, the patient came to the unit for consultation, maintaining both pain relief and the rest of the symptoms. The patient had not used the foot accompanying the patient and his family without any symptoms.
Given this situation, it was decided to review the patient within four weeks continuing during this time with rehabilitation exercises.
Four weeks later, due to the persistence of the previous situation, it was decided, in agreement with the family, to explant both the generator and the spinal cord electrode, which was done under general anesthesia again in the operating room.
The patient is currently asymptomatic and has a normal life.
