A 52-year-old male patient came to the emergency department complaining of loss of vision in his right eye for a week.
The patient had a history of right nephrectomy for renal carcinoma seven years before and right pneumonectomy for pulmonary metastasis three months before.
He did not follow any treatment at that time.
Her visual acuity was 0.1 in her right eye and left eye. The anterior pole and intraocular pressure were normal.
Funduscopy of the right eye revealed a uniform whitish-colored choroidal mass associated with intraocular inflammation of the temporal arcade of approximately four papillary diameters, with retinal detachment (RD).
The left eye was normal.
B-mode ultrasound showed a cupuliform choroidal mass of 3x6 mm high-medium reflectivity, without choroidal exfoliation.
Angiography showed a mass with hypofluorescence in early phases, late hyperfluorescence and a slightly mottled pattern.
Given the patient's history, an appointment was requested to the physician's office, which performed the appropriate tests to rule out progression of the process.
At this time, the size of the lesion and associated RD increased, affecting the macula.
Initially, radiotherapy was proposed to the patient, but he refused it and chose the surgical option.
Enucleation was performed one month after diagnosis.
Anatomopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of metastasis of renal carcinoma, without exceeding choroids and without optic nerve.
During a one-year follow-up, at the physician's office, progression of the process was not observed and the patient only received immunotherapy with interferon.
One year after the diagnosis of choroidal metastasis, signs of progression have appeared and the patient has also received radiotherapy and chemotherapy, with no clear improvement.
