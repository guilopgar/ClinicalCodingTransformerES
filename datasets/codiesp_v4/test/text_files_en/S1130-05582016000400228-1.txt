A 9-year-old woman presented with protrusion of the nasal root after 3 years of age.
In the last year, before admission, an increase in this deformity was detected, causing cosmetic alteration and anxiety with schooling problems.
The physical examination only highlights frontal boiling on the nasal root without pain due to palpation or other relevant pathological data.
1.
The study with cranial computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed deformity of the frontal sinus, without occupation of the sinus; normal thickness sinus walls.
No intracranial lesions were found.
It also presents concomitant right parietal lesion compatible with fibrous dysplasia focus.
1.
Hormonal testing reveals normal levels for age.
The patient underwent surgery, performing a coronal incision that exposes frontal bone and nasal root, being able to appreciate a bulging of the frontal sinus.
Multifragmentation and fixation of the anterior wall of the sinus were performed, preserving its mucosa, using an ultrasonic scalpel.
Removal is defined as a bone defect with resorbable mesh (polylactic and polyglycolic acids).
Resection and internal cortical parietal lesion resection were performed.
1.
The patient has no post-surgical complications with a favorable evolution.
The subsequent cosmetic result was optimal.
The histological study of the parietal lesion was non-pathological.
A clinical follow-up of the patient was carried out for only one year, due to the transfer of the patient's home due to family causes, without recurrence or discomfort in the intervention region.
