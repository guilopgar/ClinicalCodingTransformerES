We report the case of a 45-year-old patient admitted to the Hematology Service due to MM Ig G Kappa stage III-A with hepatic impairment.
She had no personal or family history of interest.
The patient was admitted to the Ophthalmology Department due to right eye (RE) red symptoms of 24 hours of evolution without any other visual or ocular symptoms.
Visual acuity was unity in both eyes and in the cleft lip a painless, vascularized and subconjunctival superior nasal mass was observed in the RE.
The rest of the examination including eye fundus was normal.
The lesion progressed 48 hours after placement of the upper eyelid producing stenosis of the right eye.
Computed tomography (CT) showed soft tissue enlargement without bone lesions.
Biopsy of the lesion revealed inactive plasma cells.
The patient was undergoing chemotherapy with: Vincristine, Uracil, Cyclophoamide and Prednisone, followed by Vincristine, Uracil, Adriamycin
Local radiation therapy was used to confirm the biopsy.
Despite the treatment of QT and RTin, the patient responded poorly to topical treatment (progressing by eyelids and conjunctiva, developing post-rabecular glaucoma with intraocular pressure (IOP) of 50 mmHg beta-blocker than did not.
The radiotherapy was suspended and the chemotherapy was suspected by Cyclophoamide, Dexamethasone, Bortezomid and Adriamycin, followed by Methotrexate, Cytarabine
This second line of CT produced remission of the bladder in two weeks, normalizing IOP with normal visual fields, although with ptosis and residual ocular motility restriction.
Despite remission of ocular symptoms, the patient died at six months.
