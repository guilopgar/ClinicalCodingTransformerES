A 28-year-old male patient suffered a blunt trauma to his left eye during an aggression.
In the initial emergency examination, a significant reduction in VA due to a hyphema was observed in this eye; IOP was 8 mmHg and Berlin's edema was observed in the eye fundus.
The patient is treated with relative rest, cycloplegia, topical and systemic corticosteroids.
After hyphema reabsorption, VA improved to 1, but IOP was 4 mmHg. Treatment continued with restriction of physical effort, 1% atropine and topical corticoids decreased ocular fold edema.
The suppression of topical corticosteroids did not improve the clinical picture either.
The gonioscopy showed an open angle grade IV without other alterations.
Ten months after the trauma, an ultrasonic biomycosis (UBM) was performed, which showed a tear in the iris root in the nasal area with 360 ciliochoroidal detachment.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) shows foveal thickening (326 lesions).

Due to the lack of response to conservative treatment, it was decided to perform a transscleral cyclopexy with contact diode laser diode G probe Oculight SLx (Iris Medical Instruments, California).
In the first 24 hours there were no changes in VA or IOP, but from the week there was a gradual increase in IOP, with the 6th month of 12 mmHg, which was accompanied by a decrease in foretinal fold edema.
Median BMU was confirmed the closure of the cyclodialysis by means of a peripheral anterior synechiae and the disappearance of choroidal detachment, which justify the normalization of IOP.
At one year of follow-up, VA was 1 and IOP was 14 mmHg.
