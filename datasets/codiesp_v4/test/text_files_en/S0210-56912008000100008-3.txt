A 60-year-old man presented to the hospital with a two-hour precordial pain.
The ECG revealed a subepicardial lesion current compatible with an inferior AMI, a depression of point J along with a descending D-ST in leads V1-V2 and a horizontal D-ST in V3 a
Fibrinolytic treatment was administered with tenecteplase and lidocaine for extrasystolic ventricular tachycardia.
An hour and a half after the ECG, recorded without pain, revealed a J wave marked in leads V1-V2 and absence of ST segment displacement.
One day after the ECG showed a lower T wave inversion, a J wave in leads V1-V2 and a concave T-wave E-ST in leads V2 to V4.
Creatine kinase increased to 1,143 U/l (with a MB fraction of 102).
An echocardiogram revealed inferomental akinesia.
The hospital clinical course had no significant incidences.
Four years after discharge, ECG showed a J-wave in the lower and anterior leads, and a concave T-wave STE in leads V2 to V4 suggesting PES.
