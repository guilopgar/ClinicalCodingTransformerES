A 54-year-old female patient was diagnosed with partial edentulism of both arches and severe alveolar sequestration class III of Sept1 in the edentulous premaxilla region.

The treatment plan consists of placing two hydrogel pearls sterilized in an autoclave for tissue expansion of the premaxilla, and a subsequent block bone allograft in the same place.
Two weeks after the placement of hydrogel pearls, exposure and removal of them were performed, with placement of medium wound block was possible discharge stereotactic marking, not preformed translithotomy incisions and tension could be performed.

Once the healing phase of the block finished, the dental implants were placed in an appropriate position, with very good bone rehabilitation and blocking.
