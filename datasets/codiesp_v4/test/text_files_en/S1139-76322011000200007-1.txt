You are a 13-year-old boy who comes to the health center with his mother, who asks for the anti-crystulose vaccine to be applied.
He presents a study trip to the United States and states that it is one of the requirements for access to education in certain centers in that country.
The non-availability of the vaccine in the health center is reported, as it is not a vaccination present in the current immunization schedule of the Community of Madrid, as well as the possibility of International Vaccination Center.
However, the mother reports that, because of her profession, she has access to this vaccine and asks only for it to be applied in the center, providing the vaccine to her own family.
After administration of the vaccine and complaining of pain at the injection site in the child with dizziness, care should be taken according to the protocol.
Reviewing the outer carton of the vaccine package, it appears that the 2 ml vial that has been inoculated is not monodose, the usual presentation form of the vaccines, but contains 20 doses, given by subcutaneous injection.
After verifying that the child's condition is good and has normal vital signs, the family is informed of the mistake made and the relevant health authorities are informed.
In order to gather as much information as possible about the vaccine, we contact the Institute of Toxicology and the Department of Preventive Medicine of the University Hospital 12 Octubre, Management of the Site Manufacturing Area of Spain (Spain).
Clinical follow-up was carried out to the girl in the Infectious Diseases Service of the University Hospital 12 de Octubre for six months, carrying out analytical studies with immunity tests, all the tests being normal both at the beginning of the event.
She did not develop any type of reaction at the injection site in the immediate period or during follow-up, so she was discharged without any incidence.
She did not receive any anti-tuberculous treatment during follow-up.
