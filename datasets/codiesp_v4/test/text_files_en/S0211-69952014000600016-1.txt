A 55-year-old patient underwent cadaveric transplantation.
Induction: daclizumab-tacrolimus-MMF-steroids.
Maintenance: tacrolimus-MMF-steroids.
Creatinine 1 and 1.2 mg/dl; creatinine clearance: 96 ml, without proteinuria.
Nine months after transplantation the patient developed viruria (107 copies/ml) for BKV, with no renal dysfunction and negative viremia.
High viruria persists with negative viremia, which is positive at month 12 (> 104 copies/ml), biopsy shows interstitial nephritis, tubular nuclear abnormalities linked to BKV.
Medication prescribed to sirolimus 2 mg/day was administered concomitantly with ciprofloxacin 500 mg/day (10 days).
It maintains stable values of renal function, with clearance of 86 ml, no proteinuria and decreased viral load in urine and blood.
Currently the patient preserves his kidney and does not require dialysis.
