A 48-year-old Caucasian male with CRF secondary to renal hypoplasia started hemodialysis in 1984.
That same year he received his first living donor kidney transplant, his father, who remained a functional until 1997, when he returned to hemodialysis for chronic graft nephropathy and underwent transplantectomy.
In 1999, he received his second kidney from a cadaveric donor, returning to hemodialysis in November 2002 after the development of a glomerulonephritis nonproliferative secondary to HCV on renal graft.
«No-A, non-B» hepatitis was diagnosed in 1984 and a liver biopsy in 2000 showed chronic periportal hepatitis (P3L3F2) with positive HCV RNA (type 3).
After the patient returned to hemodialysis to be included again in the kidney transplant list, treatment with IFN-α was started in March 2003, 3 million units three times a week.
In April 2003, the patient presented with renal pain, hematuria and fever. INF-α was discontinued and a scheduled transplantectomy was performed due to acute rejection and severe chronic histological lesions.
In August that same year, HCV-RNA negativization was confirmed despite having received one month of antiviral treatment.
However, in January 2004, the patient presented a recurrence, so that antiviral treatment was reintroduced and maintained for 12 months with SVR without recurrence.
In February 2008 he received his third kidney transplant from a cadaver donor.
Currently, the patient has normal renal function and has an undetectable viral load five years after the end of treatment.
