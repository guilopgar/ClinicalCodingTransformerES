The patient was a 77-year-old male with a history of chronic atrial fibrillation who suffered a massive resection of the intestinal ischemia and iliac, and half had an anastomosis and ascending colonic fibrillation.
After a two-month hospital stay, the patient was sent home with HPN seven days a week and infused over 10 hours.
His usual caregiver was his wife, 72 years old, affected by an incipient Parkinson's disease.
She also had a close family involved.
HPN was maintained for 11 years, being suspended due to clinical deterioration caused by community-acquired pneumonia.
The total duration was 3.940 days.
During this period she had 5 catheter-related infections (infection rate: 1.3 episodes per 1,000 days of HPN) and 1 accidental catheter exit.
The catheter had to be changed 4 times (mean catheter life: 788 days).
Since two years after the onset of HPN, she presented mild, non-progressive hepatic steatosis.
She was hospitalized four times due to complications of the technique.
The functional situation at the beginning of HPN was an independent active life and became sedentary but autonomous at the end of it.
During the first eight years of HPN traveled once or twice a year to enjoy a few days of vacation on the beach.
