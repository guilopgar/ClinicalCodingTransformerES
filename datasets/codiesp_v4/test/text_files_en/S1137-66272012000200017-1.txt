A 43-year-old male, previously healthy and asymptomatic, who came to the Department of Thoracic Surgery to complete the study of a mediastinal tumor identified in a routine study.
1.
In the pharyngoesophageal study, after administration of barium contrast, a stenosis of about 3 cm in length is observed in the middle third of the esophagus with well-defined contours and reducing esophageal lumen by 50%.
These findings are compatible with an extrinsic compression process.
1.
Right videothoracoscopy was performed in three ways.
The presence of a mobile, hard, mobile tumor in the middle mediastinum at the level of the azygos vein (cef the vein) without adhesions to the attached structures was identified.
The dissection begins by opening the mediastinum and separating the tumor from what seems to be muscular fibers of the esophagus (the latter is performed by videothoracoscopy hook and electric scalpel).
This enucleates the tumor measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.
On its deep edge the esophageal mucosa is identified in which it is checked its tightness.
The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged 48 hours later.
In the review performed 6 months after surgery, the patient was asymptomatic and had a completely normal life, without dysphagia or gastroesophageal reflux disease, respiratory distress and normal function tests.
The pathological report of the fragment was diagnosed as esophageal leiomyoma.
Macroscopically, it had a size of 5 cm, irregular shape, polylobulated surface, and with a certain tendency to form eddies.
Acetatosis is defined as a multidirectional, multidirectional, multidirectional, anti-actin positive muscle bundle with no cellular atypia or mitosis.
Sometimes hyaline amorphous material appears as irregularly distributed droplets.
