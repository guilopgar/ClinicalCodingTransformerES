A 25-year-old male operated on for left varicocele for six months, who consulted for a problem of recurrent urinary tract infections without sexual pathology.
Urethrography revealed retrograde cystourethrography and voiding cystourethrography, which indicated the presence of incomplete urethral duplication originating in the ventral urethra and passing through.
Surgical resection of the accessory pathway was performed by perineal route.
Subsequent imaging controls showed the existence of a normal bulbar urethra.
The voiding symptoms have not reappeared in the two years since the intervention.
