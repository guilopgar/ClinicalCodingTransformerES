We present a 63-year-old patient with a history of hypertension and angina pectoris, referred to our service from a hospital in a rural area.
The reason for consultation was the incidental finding on ultrasound of a left renal mass, without any symptoms.
Blood tests revealed only a mild stenosis.
Located foot studies 10 were performed in which a mass effect was observed at the left flank level, with smooth and well-defined edge, dependent on the upper pole of the left kidney, with compression of the urethra x system.
The CT scan revealed a 17 x 12 x 19 cm mass in the upper pole of the left kidney, with cystic areas, compatible with multilocular cystic nephroma, without lymphadenopathy.
DMSA scintigraphy showed differential renal function of 63% for the right kidney and 37% for the left kidney.
1.
A new ultrasound showed an image compatible with a large hydatid cyst with structures compatible with vesicles inside.
The hydatid serology was negative, so it was decided to submit the patient to a NMR that did not clarify the diagnosis definitively: mass in the upper pole of the left kidney with hydatid cyst and complex internal structure renal cyst.
In view of the above results, the next step was the ultrasound guided puncture of the renal mass, being again negative serology for hydatid disease, although a fluid of crystalline aspect was obtained.
Finally, the patient underwent surgical intervention in which the diagnosis of renal hydatid cyst was confirmed and partial cystectomy was performed, preparing the operating field with diapers bathed.
1.
Postoperative evolution was favorable and treatment with albendazole 400 mg every 12 hours for one month after surgery was instituted.
At present, the patient remains asymptomatic (the arterial hypertension that was already present before the diagnosis is maintained) and the serology of control remains negative, with minimal recurrence.
