A 58-year-old woman was referred for abdominal discomfort.
She was operated on for breast carcinoma in 1996.
A year later, an abdominal ultrasound and CT scan showed a multicystic pancreatic mass with puncture aspiration biopsy negative for malignant cells.
Asymptomatic until the year 2000 when she began with abdominal pain.
Physical and laboratory examination was rigorously normal.
Blood tumor markers (CEA, Ca 125 and Ca 19.9) were negative.
Abdominal ultrasound: multiple cystic formations at the level of the entire pancreatic cell, multitasked, with solid component and some microcalcifications of diverse size, the largest being 3 cm, and without flow
All this is compatible with giant pancreatic cystadenoma.
Abdominal CT and contrast-enhanced MRI confirmed these findings.
Puncture aspiration was performed with needle aspiration of one of the cysts, not malignant cells.
Tumor markers in cystic fluid show Ca 125: 786 IU/ml (vn: 0-35), Ca 19.9: 174 IU/ml (vn: 0-37), and normal CEA.
A giant cystadenoma of the pancreas, probably serous, is diagnosed.
The patient has not presented clinical changes since the first imaging study six years ago.
After commenting on it with the interested party and with the Surgery Department, both reject surgical treatment at the moment.
