The patient was a 35-year-old male who suffered a motorcycle accident.
On admission, HTWCT showed an intimal laceration of 7 mm in the thoracic aorta after the exit of the brachiocephalic trunk.
The patient underwent right parietal craniotomy and urgent evacuation of a subdural hematoma.
Treatment with intravenous labetalol was initiated for the strict control of SAD and the management of associated lesions was prioritized due to its severity.
The TOEC one week later showed improvement with respect to the admission, 15 days later the magnetic resonance angiography (NMR-angio) reported a normal distribution of the exit of the supraaortic trunks suggestive of traumatic rupture of the aorta without images.
One month after admission, the patient was discharged.
