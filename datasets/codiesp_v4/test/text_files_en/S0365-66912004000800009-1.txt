A 53-year-old woman diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis at 29 years of age with multiple facial lesions (sebaceous adenoma).
Background: Fibrocystic breast disease and colloid goiter.
Your parents and children have no signs of the disease.
Seizures that have been triggered in the right eye for two years
The examination showed multiple facial lesions with distribution in butterfly wings, with a flat appearance, well delimited (some overlap), reddish and non-squamative axis of approximately 0.4 to 0.8 cm.
Periungual fibromas (Koeman's thyroids) and hypopigmented spot in the chest are present in both toes and hands.
In the lower left eyelid, there are two nodular lesions that affect the dealate free edge, of cystic appearance and white-yellowish color, located in the middle third and outer 1/3 of the eyelid 0.5 cm.
The clinical diagnosis was epidermal inclusion cysts.
The rest of the examination (bulging sound) as systemic (cranial, thoracic and abdominal CT) were normal.
Surgical treatment consisted of resection of the two tumors associated with stenosis through two wedges, with good aesthetic and functional results.
The histopathological diagnosis was angiofibroma due to the presence of collagen proliferation associated with angiomatous hyperplasia.
After 18 months of follow-up there was no evidence of recurrence.
