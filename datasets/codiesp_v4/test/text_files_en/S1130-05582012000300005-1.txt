The patient presented to our clinic with a large left cervical tumor.
The patient had a history of surgery for a branchial cyst in the same location 18 years ago.
Slow and painless growth of the mass of approximately 10 years of evolution.
The tumor limits include the left largest body of hyoid bone at the anterior level, the mastoid region at the upper level, the clavicle at the lower part and the external occipital protuberance at the posterior border.
1.
The consistency of the mass is soft and is not adhered to deep planes.
No masses or adenopathies were detected and intraoral examination was normal.
The rest of the physical examination was completely anodyne.
It was decided to perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck showing a homogeneous, well-defined mass without neighboring structures and with a fat density.
1.
A sample was taken by needle aspiration (FNA), which confirmed the initial suspicion of malignancy.
It was decided to perform surgical excision of the tumor.
An approach was performed at the level of the posterior line of the hair, resecting a 5*10cm cutaneous bone to improve direct closure.
1.
During the intervention a piece of 459.5g weight and dimensions of 25*16*4.8cm were obtained.
After the first postoperative day, the patient developed a hematoma at the level of the posterior suture, requiring urgent evacuation and performing a small vessel hemostasis at the level of rapid growth left muscle.
After the seventh postoperative day, the patient was discharged.
Pathological studies confirmed the diagnosis of non-atypia
Currently the patient has a satisfactory evolution and is in control in our outpatient clinics.
