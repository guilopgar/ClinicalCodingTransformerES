A 3-year-old male weighing 18 kg was admitted to hospital due to acute renal failure and septic shock (maximum normal adrenaline 1 Î¼g/kg/min, mechanical ventilation 11 days, disseminated intravascular coagulation [CI]).
APD was initiated at 36 hours due to oligoanuria ( diuresis of 0.1 ml/kg/h) of 24 hours of evolution, net balance of +1.200 ml and creatinine increase, later 2 mg/dl).
On day 1, with an ultrafiltered gradient of 685 ml in 24 h, with hourly passages of 12 ml/kg of glucose to 1.36%, 20 minutes of permanence, the glucose-to-fasting ratio was 0.73 D ureat and creatinine respectively
Subsequently, it was necessary to increase the glucose concentration to 3.27% to maintain ultra effective.
On day 12, 3.27% liquid every 2 h, 40 dwelling time, with 12 ml/kg, D/P, 0.27 % creatinine and Ddl respectively increased as much as 2 hr creatinine per minute with a rate of 0.94, respectively.
On day 15 the cellularity of the dialysate increased and on day 16 the peritoneal catheter was removed (C. albicans growth).
