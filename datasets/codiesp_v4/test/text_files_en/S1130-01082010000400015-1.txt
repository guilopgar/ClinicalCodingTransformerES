We present an 85-year-old patient with a cecal angiosarcoma.
The patient was admitted to our hospital with rectal bleeding.
On admission she presented hypotension and tachycardia, and physical examination showed mucocutaneous stiffness and abdominal distension.
Rectal examination showed reddish white precipitating blood without identification of any tumor.
Laboratory tests revealed a hemoglobin level of 4.3 g/dl. Low digestive endoscopy revealed a reddish mass of 1 cm in the cecum with active bleeding. Biopsies were obtained after biopsies were controlled with clips.
Twelve hours later the patient developed a new episode of gastrointestinal bleeding with hypotension, so an urgent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was performed.
The patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day.
The extension study performed after surgery was negative.
In the macroscopic analysis, the cecum contained a 2 cm exophytic ulcer. Microscopic analysis showed multiple anastomotic vascular channels that dissected the collagen and smooth muscle layers to the lamina propria and lamina propria.
Immunohistochemistry showed great reactivity of tumor cells against CD31 and vimentin.
The staining for CD34, cytokeratin 20 and cytokeratin AE1-3 were negative.
A diagnosis of epithelioid angiosarcoma of the colon was made.
The margins were tumor free as well as the 12 lymph nodes analyzed.
The patient did not receive adjuvant treatment and in the subsequent follow-up she remains alive and without evidence of disease two years after surgery.
