A 79-year-old woman with no history of interest presented with diarrhea and a one-year history of general syndrome.
Physical examination revealed a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa, which was confirmed on plain abdominal radiography.
Abdominal computed tomography revealed the presence of a large liver mass with exophytic growth into the right iliac fossa suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma.
The pancreas, spleen, kidneys, uterus and ovaries were normal.
Hepatotropic virus serology was negative and serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were within normal limits.
After aspiration biopsy of the lesion revealed a well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.
Once surgical resection was ruled out due to tumor size and suspicion of vascular invasion, treatment with chemoembolization was initiated with good results.
Currently, after six months of follow-up, the patient is asymptomatic.
