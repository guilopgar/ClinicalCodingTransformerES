Diffuse macular edema treated with laser six months before and with maximum visions of 0.3 in the right eye and 0.250 in the left eye stood out as antecedents.

In the systemic examination a weight gain of 7 kilos (data reported by your primary care physician) with peripheral oedemas in the extremities is highlighted.
Visual acuity was 0.05 in both eyes.
At the bottom of the eye, severe bilateral diffuse macular edema was observed.
Due to the generalized retention of fluids a systemic examination was performed, ruling out renal and/or cardiac pathology establishing the association with rosiglitazone.
This drug was withdrawn and two months later, the patient had lost 5kg of consciousness and edemas.
Macular edema did not decrease and visual acuity at three months was 0.05 in both eyes.
