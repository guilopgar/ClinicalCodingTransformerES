An 8-day-old, female, preterm infant of 36 weeks and high weight (3,600 gr.), who suffered peripartum asphyxia with moderate-severe neonatal encephalopathy.
Due to peripartum asphyxia, treatment with systemic hypothermia using CritiCool® system (MTRE, Mennen Medical, USA) is performed in the district hospital of origin.
Eight days after admission, the patient was admitted to the Pediatric Surveillance Unit of Hospital 12 de Octubre.
During his stay in this unit interconsultation to the Plastic Surgery Service for dorsal skin lesion of early onset is passed.
In the evaluation we observed a tumor in the back, midline, of 11x13x4 cm fluctuating, with a partially irregular neck in diameter of approximately 5 cm.
We requested a soft tissue ultrasound to establish the diagnosis, which reports liquefactive fat necrosis.
We performed 2 punctures to evacuate the contents unsuccessfully, because we performed surgical debridement and vacuum therapy (Renasys®, Smith&Nephew®, London, UK).
The therapy was arranged at a pressure of 100 mmHg, performing continuous cycles and dressing changes every 72 hours.
1.
The patient underwent surgery after 21 days of treatment with vacuum therapy, presenting at the time of surgery a good-looking wound, with a background of granulation tissue and without exudate.
Tissues were advanced, leaving a central bloody area of 1 cm2.
The patient was admitted to the Neonatology Service of our hospital and finally discharged 5 days after surgery, with an age of 45 days.
After 8 months of evolution, the patient presented a stable wound, without pain, which allowed her to live a normal life, with 2 points based on the Vancouver Healing Scale (Vancouver Scar).
