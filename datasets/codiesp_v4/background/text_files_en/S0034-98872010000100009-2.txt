A 31-year-old patient with a history of CF diagnosed at 2 years of age with regular treatment and controls until May 2000, who underwent bilateral lung transplantation, with a very good outcome until 2009.
The current picture was characterized by respiratory bronchiolitis diagnosed as obliterans and was hospitalized for treatment.
On the third day of hospitalization, the patient complained of progressive colic abdominal pain, mostly located in the right lower abdomen, associated with three episodes of vomiting.
On physical examination the abdomen was distended and tender in the right hemiabdomen with bulging.
It was decided to take a simple abdominal X-ray that showed a moderate dilation of the loops of the small intestine in the upper hemiabdomen in addition to the presence of abundant air and estercoaceous content throughout the colonic framework.
A computed tomography of the abdomen was also requested, which showed a significant dilation of the small intestine in the upper portion of the rectum and the proximal part of the ileum that seemed occupied and distended by SOID.
Treatment was initiated with a dose of GastrografinÂ® (100 my collides in 400 mi. of saline) presenting after 2 hours, a large amount of liquid stools and a significant decrease in symptoms.
A plain control abdominal X-ray showed dyspnoea of some small bowel loops to a lesser degree than in the previous examination in addition to the presence of contrast in the distal intestine and colonic frame.
The patient was discharged with a supplement of pancreatic enzymes and was in good condition after 10 months of hospitalization without presenting new abdominal pain, dyspnoea or constipation.
