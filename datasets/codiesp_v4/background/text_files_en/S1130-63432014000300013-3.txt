A 52-year-old male who, during the second instillation with an intravesical gember, experienced intense local pain, sensation of urethral tenderness and tennis (grade 2), continued to develop nausea and vomiting after immediate discontinuation.
Treatment was discontinued at the request of the patient.
Two weeks later, the patient started an intravesical treatment with MMC, with good tolerance after four instillations.
