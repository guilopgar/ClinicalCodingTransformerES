A 65-year-old patient presented with a progressive increase in PSA levels from 6 ng/ml to 12 ng/ml in the last year.
This patient had undergone a negative transrectal sextant-guided prostate biopsy one year before.
It was decided to perform an E-RME before the second transrectal biopsy in cases of PSA elevation, in which a hypointense lesion covering the central and peripheral area of the apex of the lobe D is observed.
The spectroscopic study of this lesion showed a choline curve slightly higher than the citrate curve, with a Ch-Cr/Ci echography index > that suggested the presence of a biopsy due to this lesion.
The biopsy PA confirmed the presence of a prostate ADK Gleason 6.
