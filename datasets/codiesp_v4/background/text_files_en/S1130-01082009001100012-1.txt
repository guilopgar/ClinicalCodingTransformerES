A 34-year-old woman diagnosed with attenuated FAP underwent total laparoscopic colectomy.
Twenty months after surgery anterolateral abdominal wall tumor was observed at the level of the scar of the right flank trocar.
CT and MRI were requested to confirm the existence of this neoplasm, compatible with desmoid tumor without adjacent structures.
Prior to surgery, the patient was treated with Indomethacin 75 mg/24 h and tamoxifen 10 mg/12 h for 2 months, after which a new CT scan was performed, which revealed the absence of tumor growth.
Surgical intervention was decided: removal of the tumor and anterolateral abdominal wall by healthy limits and resection of 40 cm distal jejunum and manual termino-terminal anastomosis, because it was found as an incidental finding, another mesocolonized tumor.
Abdominal wall reconstruction was performed using ProceedÂ® 20 x 30 cm prosthesis.
