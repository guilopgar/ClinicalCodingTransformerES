A 62-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes.
Ten days after starting ciprofloxacin (500 mg/12h) indicated for a perianal abscess, the patient complained of pain and functional impotence in the left Achilles tendon.
The apex formation shows a clear thickening of the tendon.
MRI showed a fusiform thickening of the middle and upper third of the left Achilles tendon, with an intrasustance rupture in its musculotendinous junction and without retraction.
Ciprofloxacin was discontinued and the symptoms resolved within two months after rest, with the use of NSAIDs and rehabilitated treatment.
