We report the case of a 47-year-old woman who was referred for myodesopsias in the left eye.
Personal history: ex-addict to parenteral drugs, infected with HIV, diagnosed five years ago and with rejection to treatment.
Location: visual acuity (VA) was normal in the unit, anterior pole and intraocular pressure.
Funduscopically we found an isolated focus of vasculitis in the lower middle temporal periphery without choroiditis, with mild associated colitis, angiographically confirmed.
We report the case to the Internal Medicine Department, who was admitted for study, determination of viral load,000 copies/ml), and CD4 lymphocytes (130).
A thorough clinical examination and complementary tests were performed to find the cause of vasculitis in this HIV patient.
Blood count, coagulation, biochemistry and urine analysis were normal, as well as blood cultures and urine cultures.
Mantoux and serology of toxoplasma, herpes, RPR, FTA-ABS, VDRL, cytomegalovirus (CMV), heterophilic antibodies were negative.
Tumor markers, rheumatoid factor, ANA, ANCAS, HLA A29, B51, DR2, DR3, DR4 and B52 also within normal parameters.
Chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) of the brain and abdomen showed no abnormalities.
After ruling out the associated opportunistic infectious pathology, tumor and autoimmune causes, it was decided to start antiretroviral treatment, in addition to descending systemic corticosteroids for the control of ocular inflammation.
The response to treatment was good, with resolution of the symptoms, so she was discharged with the diagnosis of HIV vasculitis.
She is currently asymptomatic and on antiretroviral treatment.
