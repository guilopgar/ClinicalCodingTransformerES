A 58-year-old patient with no personal history of interest presented with rectal bleeding.
The examination revealed a mamelon lesion in the rectosigmoid junction. Biopsy revealed nonspecific inflammation. The patient was referred to our center for reassessment when malignancy was suspected.
Endoscopy showed a friable area of 1 cm with small erythematous nipples.
Pathologically, there were globular deposits and few linear fragments of Congo red amyloid positive permanganate resistant (LA), being reported as focal globular amyloidosis.
Diagnosis was made exhaustively, but after a one-year follow-up the origin of the amyloid in this patient remains unknown.
