A 23-year-old man presented with right-sided diplopia and diplopia after a traffic accident with a right blow-out fracture.
Correction was performed by performing a scaled graft of callus prior to the right orbit floor and addition of platelet-rich plasma gel, 11 months after the accident, through an infraorbital scar approach.
Both in the postoperative period and at 16 weeks, more symmetrical pupillary axes and significant improvement of right ocular globe and especially post-traumatic diplopia are observed.
