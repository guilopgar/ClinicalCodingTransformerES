A 31-year-old woman was referred in October 2012 for pruritus and was admitted for a clinical-analytical picture compatible with acute non-severe hepatitis.
In the anamnesis she reported a tattoo 10 years ago and taking Inneov capillary mass® for a month.
Physical examination was normal.
Laboratory results and abdominal ultrasound are summarized in Table I. Immunology and viral serology were negative.
On the fifth day of stopping Inneov capillary mass®, clinical improvement was observed, with disappearance of pruritus, and analytical, with normalization of liver function tests three months later.
Causality using the CIOMS/RUCAM scale in case 2 and 3 was highly probable.
