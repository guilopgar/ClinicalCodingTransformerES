A 43-year-old woman presented with episodes of abdominal pain and diarrhea for 6 months.
The patient did not notice rectal bleeding or weight loss.
Physical examination showed no significant alterations.
The analytical study showed the following altered parameters: Hb: 9.8 g/dl. Fe: 13 mcg/100 (vn: 50-140).
Biochemical parameters and tumor markers (CEA and Ca 19.9) were normal.
The attachment revealed a giant mobile polypoid tumor in the splenic flexure and descending colon, which prevented the passage of the endoscope.
The head of the lesion was ulcerated.
Biopsies were negative for malignancy.
An abdominal CT scan revealed an invagination image in the descending colon.
The patient was admitted before the scheduled date for surgery due to a new and more intense episode of suboptimal seizure.
A large polypoid tumor of wide base in the descending colon, close to the splenic angle, was observed during the intervention.
A left hemicolectomy was performed.
The histological report showed a submucosal lesion in the splenic angle of 5 cm, which ulcerated the mucosa.
Twenty-two lymph nodes were isolated.
