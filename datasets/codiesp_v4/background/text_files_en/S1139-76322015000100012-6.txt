A three-year-old woman presented with erythema and vulvar itching, compatible with vaginitis, with no other accompanying symptoms.
Treatment was prescribed with topical clotrimazole and washed with pediatric gel.
Four months later, the patient presented a new episode of vaginitis, this time of greater intensity, so that samples were collected to rule out perianal oxyuriasis and stenosis dermatitis.
Clinical suspicion was established and treatment with oral penicillin was initiated for ten days.
The Graham test was negative, while in the culture growth of GABHS and Streptococcus accumiae was detected.
After the treatment with penicillin, the symptoms resolved.
