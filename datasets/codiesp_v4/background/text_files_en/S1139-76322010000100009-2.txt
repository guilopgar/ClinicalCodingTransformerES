A 5-year-old male patient, with no relevant medical history, came to the dental office for presenting a fistula in the vestibular mucosa in the upper right central.
The father reported that at 2 years of age he had suffered a traumatism in the upper limbs and since then he had not had any associated symptoms.
Dental exploration revealed the presence of all primary dentition.
Antibiotic treatment was prescribed for one week, and an orthopantomography was requested to assess the status of malformations.
Radiography showed the presence of a mesiodens in the midline, conoid form and without complete root formation.
Its cusp was located at the apical level of 1/3 of the temporary upper jaws.
The upper central incisors had only the crown formed.
Both were rotated, with the buccal faces towards the midline and the palatal faces towards the lateral faces.
The lateral tapes were well positioned, but slightly lower than the central ones.
It is recommended to perform pulpotomy of the upper right temporal lobe.
It was decided to wait for definitive central catheters to be more formed and in a more favorable position before extracting the supernumerary.
Six and a half years later, the patient underwent surgical removal of the mesiodens and temporary central catheters.
At 7 years of age, none of the above mentioned pathologies have been erupted yet, but the radiological study shows that they have a more favorable position for their eruption.
