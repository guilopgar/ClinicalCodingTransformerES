A 54-year-old patient with a diagnosis of recurrent nodular hydroadenoma was scheduled for extended local surgical resection and reconstruction.
The resulting defect was 13 x 9 cm. For this type of defect we designed a flap with retrograde flow based on the vascular network of the knee.
After identifying and dissecting the perforating vessel to the skin island and its continuation with the descending branch of the lateral circumflex artery, ligation was performed in its proximal part.
For flap transposition we prefer to continue the wound until the defect.
It should be noted that the rotation point is approximately 5 cm above the patella.
