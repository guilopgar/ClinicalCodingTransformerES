A 32-year-old man presented with fever and abdominal pain for the last 10 days.
A CT scan showed a cystic lesion of 7 cm, with some calcification adjacent to the gastric fundus, compressing the greater curvature, without contact with pancreas or spleen.
Digestive endoscopy showed a greater curvature compression without mucosal changes.
Laparoscopic surgery is performed but when performing the gastric section there are doubts about the diameter of the remaining gastric tube so it is decided to perform a small laparatomy and after checking for the existence of an optimal gastric cyst to finish gastric resection.
The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 5.
Macroscopically, it was a 7 cm cyst that, when opened, contained a purulent material in which an intermedius streptococcus grew.
The analysis of this liquid showed the following values: amylase 21 IU/l, LDH: 15,351 IU/l, proteins: 13.2 g/l. undetectable glucose, CEA: 340119,1 ng
At microscopic level, we observed that in the junctional zone (cyst-stomach) the lights are fused at the level of muscle layers, but both present mucosa and submucosa.
The mucosa of the DGC has characteristics of gastric mucosa with marked inflammation, fibrosis and focal erosions, without areas of intestinal metaplasia or dystrophic alteration.
There were no complications during follow-up and no other associated malformations were detected.
