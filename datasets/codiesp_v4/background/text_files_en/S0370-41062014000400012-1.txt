At 8 months of life and in relation to loud noise, the mother presented a severe glance loss described by her mother, with intense crying, persistent blurred vision, deviation from consciousness.
He returned spontaneously after a few seconds with a normal wakefulness after this event.
These episodes continued to become more frequent and intense, up to 3-5 per day and followed by impaired consciousness and hypotonia, so he consulted neurology at 10 months where a standard EEG was performed.
At 12 months and after a fall in the floor, the patient developed a new episode of generalized apnea-hypopnea syndrome, followed by clonic seizures, which was accompanied by a tonic seizure 3
She was admitted to the emergency service where a watchful infant was found, with good psychomotor development.
A complete blood count ruled out anemia, without microcytosis, normal iron kinetics, normal electroencephalogram (EEG) and normal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
She was discharged with a diagnosis of severe cyanotic emotional apnea.
Outpatient controls were requested.
Discharge persisted with daily AE with mild to severe intensities.
As the iron kinetics study was normal, piracetam 40 mg/kg day administered in two doses for 4 months was initiated.
In subsequent controls, it was possible to verify a decrease in the frequency and intensity of seizures, with only 2 emotional apneas with mild stenosis and spontaneous recovery.
