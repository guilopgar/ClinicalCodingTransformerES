A 31-year-old patient who suffered a motorcycle accident was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital.
He had facial lesions, multiple bone fractures, pulmonary contusion and right inguinal tumor.
Clinical examination revealed a contuse, contusion-type wound with well-circumscribed borders of the dorsal penile portion of about 5 cm, affecting exclusively the skin, without any defined overflow wound cm.
The Brockman's sign (blancing pocket and voiding well developed) with normal left testicle and right testicle lodged in the ipsilateral inguinal canal painful at the touch and with impossibility of manual descent is evidenced.
The patient reported no history of testicular anomalies.
If he was hemodynamically stable, blood analysis was requested without abnormal findings and imaging tests (cranial-thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan) where there was no evidence of bilateral alveolar infiltrate with lobules in the anterior segment.
A structure of ovoid morphology was observed in the right inguinal canal, corresponding to the dislocated testicle.
He also presented left radioulnar fracture, clavicle fracture and 4o-5o metatarsal fracture of the right hand.

With the diagnosis of right testicular trauma and dislocation of the same, it was decided urgent surgical intervention due to impossibility of manual reduction.
The muscle relaxants administered during the anesthetic act showed a decrease in the testicle to the manual bag and spontaneous displacement after replacement, due to dyssynchrony.
No testicular parenchymal lesion was observed, only a small albuginea hematoma in this testicle.
Finally, closure was performed with loose points of the penile lesion.
The patient is taken to the traumatology service after the intervention, with no complications in the postoperative period and later visited in our outpatient clinics. Upon discharge, clinical controls and normal hospital morphology showed intra- and intrahospital testes.
