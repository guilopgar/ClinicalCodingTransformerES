This is a 49-year-old man whose corpse was recovered in the waters of the Sixth Aola River, Bocas del Toro province.
The witnesses saw the deceased in a river zone where a good number of crocodiles can be seen.
The corpse was recovered three days after its denouncement, in an advanced state of putative disappearance.
The autopsy revealed, as a relevant finding, traumatic amputation of the right hand and forearm, traumatic amputation of both feet and avulsive wounds with irregular edges, accompanied by loss of muscle mass.
These lesions caused massive loss of blood flow responsible for death.
