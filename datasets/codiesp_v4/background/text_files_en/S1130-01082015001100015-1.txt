A 71-year-old patient was admitted for elective surgery of right inguinal hernia.
She had a history of ischemic heart disease, high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation, and was treated with SintromÂ®.
During dissection of the hernia sac, a tubular structure corresponding to the appendix was found without signs of inflammation.
Under the protection of the field, it was decided to perform a cholecystectomy, followed by its closure to the cavity.
After cleaning the field and changing instruments and gloves, the hernia was repaired with prostitute material.
The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged 48 hours after surgery.
In subsequent controls, the patient reported no wound complications and there were no signs of hernia recurrence.
