A 30-year-old man with a 6-month HF without response to optimal medical treatment.
In June 2013, an echocardiogram showed severe left ventricular (LV) dilatation with ejection fraction (EF) 17%.
The estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) was 50 mmHg with growth and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction.
In July 2013, the patient was admitted to the ICU with FC IV (NY)-(Intermacs 3), 5 mg/kg/min dobutamine and received a 0.1 mg/kg/min infusion of dobutamine.
Due to its young age and low possibility of medium-term transplantation, we indicated implantation of DAH performed with minimally invasive technique in August 2013.
The postoperative course was excellent, with mixed oxygen > 65%, normal cardiac output and cardiac output interconnected between 5.7 L/min with 2.800 returns per minute (PRM).
The patient was discharged on the day following surgery and discharged 48 hours later.
After 9 months she remains with FC I.
