A 33-year-old male (175 cm, 80 kg), ASA I U, from a Spanish Navy ship was evacuated to our center with a diagnosis of rupture of the left Achilles tendon.
The patient was monitored similarly to previous clinical cases (SaO2, heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure, temperature, capnography and degree of hypnosis using the BIS monitor).
After administration of 250 ml colloid IV bolus, intradural anesthesia was performed using 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine.
The same anxiolytic and hypnotic medication, antibiotic, antiacid, antiemetic and antifibrinolytic prophylaxis was the same as in previous patients, performing a percutaneous suture of the lesion.
The same protocol was followed and the patient was discharged to the hospital ward.
BISÂ® monitoring showed values between 97 and 68, the capnography curve was normal and the assessment of sedation in the post-surgical recovery unit was maximum (10 points in the Aldrete Score).
