A 65-year-old patient with hypercholesterolemia and chronic ethylic pancreatitis and treated with acetylsalicylic acid was admitted for asthenia and melena.
The patient presented good general condition with skin and mucous membrane tenderness.
Arterial thrombosis, 110/60 mmHg, heart rate 82 beats/min, hemoglobin 4.6 g/dl, hematocrit 14.2 %.
Urea 67 mg/dl and creatinine 1 mg/dl. In emergency gastroscopy: chronic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia, without blood remnants up to the third duodenal portion.
Seizure: from rectum to cecum abundant red blood cells and clots with normal mucosa.
In the cecum and on the ileocecal valve there was blood and a clot, suggesting the origin in the small intestine.
