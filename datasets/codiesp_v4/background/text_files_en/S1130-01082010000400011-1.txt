A 45-year-old woman was referred due to long-standing epigastric pain refractory to treatment with proton pump inhibitors. An upper endoscopy showed a pseudobilic latissimus dorsi with a rounded mucosal diameter.
Biopsies showed mild chronic atrophic gastritis with no signs of activity or evidence of Helicobacter pylori.
The patient was referred for echoendoscopy using the radial type (Olympus GF-UE160-Al5) where a well-defined submucosal polypoid lesion with a wide base (15 millimeters) was identified.
Biopsies that were nonspecific were taken again.
Abdominal CT scan showed antral lesion of 20 x 14 millimeters of density soft tissues, peripheral enhancement without adjacent fat deposits or signs of local or distant lymphatic spread.
The patient was sent to surgery performing a partial gastrectomy.
The biopsy of the specimen described a polypoid formation with fibromyxoid proliferation with inflammatory component without evidence of malignancy suggestive of inflammatory fibroid polyp.
