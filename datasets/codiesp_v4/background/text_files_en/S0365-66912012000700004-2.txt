A 39-year-old male patient, diagnosed with AS with anterior lenticonus and phleccular pathology, presented with low VA in the RE.
He underwent cataract surgery without complications two years before.
OCT prior to surgery detected bilateral macular thickness decrease, with thinning of inner layers, mainly in the temporal macular region.
VA was 0.01 in the RE and 0.7 in the LE.
In the eye fundus of the RE, a full-thickness MA was detected, confirmed by OCT, with a diameter of 1,400μm.
The patient decided not to undergo surgery, due to expectant attitude.
Currently, AM persists, with a diameter of 2,900μm, with significant loss of connective tissue and cystic alterations.
The OI shows similar progressive thinning in the temporal macular zone with thicknesses of 164μm.
