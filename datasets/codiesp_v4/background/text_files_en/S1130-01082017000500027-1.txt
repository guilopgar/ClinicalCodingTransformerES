First, we report the case of a 17-year-old male with retrosternal pain, dysphagia and fever of 39Â°C.
Oral endoscopy showed deep longitudinal erosions with irregular edges and raised from the middle to distal esophagus.
Antibiotic treatment was initiated due to suspicion of HS, which was histologically confirmed.
In addition, the eosinophil count in the proximal esophagus was > 15 per field, compatible with EoE.
Review endoscopy one month after the end of treatment maintained endoscopic and histological signs suggestive of EoE without isolating ESR-I.
We report the case of a 36-year-old male with a history of asthma, without bronchodilator treatment, corticosteroids or antibiotics, who presented with acute dysphagia of three days duration.
Oral endoscopy showed a subcentimetric longitudinal ulcerated lesion in cardia, which pathologically showed Cowdry type A inclusions suggestive of HS.
Histologically, esophageal candidiasis and EoE coexisted.
After eight weeks of treatment with fluconazole, beta blockers and pantoprazole had abnormalities suggestive of infectious colitis, persisting those compatible with EoE.
The immunological study was normal in both patients.
