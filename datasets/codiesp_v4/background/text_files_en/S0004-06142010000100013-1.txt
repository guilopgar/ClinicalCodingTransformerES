A 34-year-old man presented to the urology department complaining of lower urinary tract obstructive symptoms (LUTS), with no other associated symptoms.
Physical examination, including rectal examination, showed no abnormalities.
Blood tests and abdominal X-rays were normal, but urine analysis showed the presence of leukocytes and erythrocytes.
Flowmetry showed a clear decrease in the maximum flow, and a filling defect was observed in the urethrocystography, which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (prostatic T2 cyst) as a homogeneous mass in the urethra.
1.
A transurethral resection of a pedunculated mass measuring about 5 cm was performed, located in the prostatic urethra.
The postoperative course was excellent.
Histological examination typically showed intertwined fascicles of spindle cells with moderate/abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and centrally located nuclei without mitotic activity.
These findings confirmed the diagnosis of LU.
