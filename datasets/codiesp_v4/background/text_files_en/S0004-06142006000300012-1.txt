The patient was a 34-year-old girl who consulted for a clinic of voiding syndrome and sensation of hypogastric discomfort of several months of evolution with urocultives performed in a negative Primary Care.
On one occasion she had an episode of self-limiting hematuria and no relevant medical or gynecological history, except for uninstrumented vaginal delivery.
In the analytical studies performed, no decent findings were observed except for mild anemia and minimal elevation of the G.S.V.
Abdominal ultrasound performed was reported as compatible with normality, so it was decided to perform a cystoscopy where a cystic lesion in the posterior wall not suggestive of typical papillary neoformation was observed.
In the practiced urethra it is reported as bladder endometriosis.

A hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with analogues is established in conjunction with the Palliative Care Service.
A year later the patient is asymptomatic and with a rigorously normal cystoscopic control study.
