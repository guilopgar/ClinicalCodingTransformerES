A 48-year-old woman underwent left breast reconstruction with a DIEP flap after mastectomy for ductal solid carcinoma of the left breast.
Postoperatively, she develops pyoderma gangrenosum on both surgical wounds (abdominal and breast).
1.
Systemic treatment with corticosteroids is administered and, after stabilization of the lesions, surgical coverage of the lesions is proposed by debridement and partial skin grafting.
The patient rejects the intervention, so we opted for a non-invasive treatment applying RenasysÂ® therapy.
Continuous therapy is established at -100 mm Hg.
After one month of treatment, breast wounds have completely healed and abdominal wounds have significantly decreased in size.
Finally, all wounds were closed without the need for surgical intervention after 7 weeks of treatment.
