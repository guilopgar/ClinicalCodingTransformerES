We report the case of a 60-year-old man with severe three-vessel coronary disease who underwent by-pass.
Postoperatively, she presents persistent upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to multiple duodenal ulcers that are treated endoscopically up to five times.
Persistence of bleeding is performed selective angiography of the gastroduodenal artery, appreciating bleeding on the sheet in its terminal duodenal branches.
Embolization of the gastroduodenal artery at the origin of the duodenal branches was performed with microcoils type NesterÂ®.
The patient had a good evolution without new signs of bleeding.
