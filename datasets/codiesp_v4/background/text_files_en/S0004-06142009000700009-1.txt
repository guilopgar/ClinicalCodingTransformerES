A 32-year-old patient reported having noticed a perineal lump since childhood.
1.
On examination, a mass was observed in the midline center of the perineum, soft and elastic, not painful and does not seem to adhere to deep planes.
Voiding urethrography was performed, showing normal bladder filling.
Morphology, liquid content and lack of communication with other structures or organs were evaluated in perineopelvic MRI; their size was 5x2x1.5 cm.
The cyst was removed under spinal anesthesia and found to be multiloculated, as seen in the surgical specimen during the intervention and already removed.
1.
The histological study showed a multilocular cystic cavity, with clear brownish liquid-mucosal content, partially retained by a pseudostratified respiratory epithelium with mucous secreting cells, PAS positive.
Immunohistochemical study of cytokeratins showed columnar cellularity and apical cells of the squamous epithelium an immunophenotype CK7, EMA, CEA positive and CK20 negative.
Two years after surgical treatment the patient is asymptomatic and without recurrence.
