A 51-year-old woman with a family history of colon cancer, diagnosed with GS (colon adenomas detected at 28 years of age, gastric polyposis, osteomas) in muscle cal√®neomas, adrenal adenoma and fibrolipoma
The genetic study, performed on two occasions, did not detect mutations in the APC gene.
In 2001, 41 years old, due to the rapid increase in the number and size of colonic adenomas, ileocolectomy was performed with ileoanal anastomosis and ileal reservoir in "J" in two stages.
After radical surgery of the rectum and colon, the patient began to present periodic, intermittent episodes, occasionally resulting in menstrual cycle pain, hypogastric pain, bloody diarrhea and anal pain with repeated fissures.
The different ileoscopies performed revealed inflammatory signs and small ulcerations in the reservoir, which became increasingly extensive and confluent; biopsies and serology ruled out CMV infection.
Endoscopic lesions and symptoms did not respond adequately to the different treatments prescribed (rofecoxib + ciprofecoxib; oral and topical metronidazole VSL#3; 5; ASA; topical steroids).
Despite the recommendation, the patient has several times ileostomy.
No new adenomas were detected in the reservoir in any of the reviews with conventional endoscopy (no pancromoscopy is available).
After surgery, and every two years, a duodenoscopy with a videoendoscopy of lateral vision has been performed.
Moreover, gastric polyposis has significantly increased in number and size.
Histology always corresponds to hypertrophic lesions.
