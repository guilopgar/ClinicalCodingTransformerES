Patient RGP, HC: 68 14 58 female, whose reason for admission is an increase in the volume of the lower lip.
The history of the disease dates back to the age of 15 when the patient received a bite in the lower lip with severe bleeding.
From the traumatism appeared in the central and right region of the lip a progressive, painless, blue-violaceous, pulsatile increase of 3 cm in diameter.
Classified as traumatic hemangioma, the lesion was treated with betamethasone injections.
After 6 doses of betamethasone, the tumor was excised orally.
Histopathological diagnosis was compatible with traumatic hemangioma.
Two years after this treatment, the patient consults us again, since she presented an increase in the lower lip volume, more vesicular, pulsatile, with murmur and frenite.
The intraoral examination shows vascular reliefs in the lower lip mucosa. We indicate ultrasound of the region and perform a dissection of the right carotid for arteriography which reports an inferior alveolar sac labial regions and level men.
1.
The external carotid artery was ligated between the superior thyroid and the lingual one, by submental incision the venous vessels of the aneurysm were ligated to isolate this cavity from the circulation.
1.
At the end of surgery, 4cc betamethasone was administered to the tumor and an elastic tape was applied.
Four additional injections with triamcinolone were administered at 3-week intervals, with progressive reduction and fibrosis of the tumor not finding a murmur.
Three months after vessel ligation, excision of fibrosis of the labial tumor was performed.
The final aesthetic result was acceptable.
At this time the patient has been five years since the last surgery, with no recurrence of the lesion.
