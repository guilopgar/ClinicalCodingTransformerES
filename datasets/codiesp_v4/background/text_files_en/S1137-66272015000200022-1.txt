We report the case of a 68-year-old man who came to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, rectal bleeding and nausea for one week.
In the last month he had presented recurrent colic abdominal pain.
She had no relevant medical history or laboratory abnormalities.
Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen, tympanic membrane tenderness, without signs of peritonitis.
Rectal examination revealed recesses healed.
The patient presented a friable and palaceous formation in an ileocecal valve, with rotation or invagination aspect.
The CT scan showed an ileocolic invagination of 12 cm with thickened walls and without intestinal obstruction.
Surgical treatment was decided, aiming at ileocecal invagination and a small cecal deerosing.
An extended resection of the cecum was performed with mechanical ileocolic anastomosis.
The anatomopathological diagnosis was invagination of the small intestine with polypoid lesion formed by mature adipocytes without lipoblasts, which is the cause of the invaginated area.
The patient had a good postoperative evolution.
