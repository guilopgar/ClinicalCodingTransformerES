A 57-year-old woman with a history of serous ovarian cystadenoma presented with a six-month history of progressive increase in abdominal perimeter.
Physical examination revealed a large abdominal disfunction.
Laboratory tests showed a slight elevation of GGT and alkaline phosphatase, the rest of the parameters being normal.
Abdominal computed tomography revealed the presence of several cystic liver masses with clear edges and liquid content, suggestive of simple cysts.
The largest cyst measured 22 x 19 cm and occupied the right hemiabdomen in its entirety displacing the right kidney to the pelvis.
There were no renal cysts.
The serology of hydatidosis was negative.
Median laparoscopy aspirated the contents of a larger cyst, total of five cysts were removed, followed by laparoscopic fentraction of the cyst from other smaller cysts without complications.
The anatomopathological study of the fragments of the cyst wall showed findings compatible with a simple cyst.
Currently, the patient is asymptomatic.
