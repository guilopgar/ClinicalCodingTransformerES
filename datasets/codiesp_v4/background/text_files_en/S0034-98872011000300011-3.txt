A 52-year-old, hypertensive, morbidly obese patient was scheduled for gastric bypass.
During anesthetic induction, without changes in BP or HR, the patient presented ST segment changes suggestive of ischemia.
TEE showed no changes in global or segmental ventricular motility.
It was decided to perform the surgery without incidents.
Postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the third day.
