A 57-year-old woman with a self-locating catheter.
After four years on PD, a small interruption or disappearance of the catheter's radiopaque line was observed, but a careful examination of the catheter did not reveal any leakage.
However, nine months later, the patient consulted for the presence of dialysate leakage through a hole located just at the point where the radio-opaque line had become obscure.
Prophylactic antibiotic treatment was administered and the catheter was repaired using the kit extension catheter segment.
There were no complications.
