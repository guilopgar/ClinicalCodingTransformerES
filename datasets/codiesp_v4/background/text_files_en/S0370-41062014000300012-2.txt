Female patient, 14 years old, 3 months old, with family history of mother with papillary thyroid carcinoma operated.
At 13 years of age, a goiter thyroid ultrasound was performed, which describes a lesion suggestive of extensive thyroid neoplasm with involvement of most of the gland, dominant nodule left lobe and left supraclavicular lymph nodes.
Taking into account his family history, it was decided to perform a total thyroidectomy without previous thyroid puncture, whose contemporary and definitive biopsy confirmed papillary thyroid carcinoma in the left lobe, itsmo and right lobe permeating diffuse sclerosing tissue.
After thyroidectomy, the patient was treated with radioiodine 150 mCi 30 days later. Systemic therapeutic screening showed only tissue uptake in the remaining thyroid.
However, 3 months after thyroidectomy, a nodule in the right thyroid bed with cervical lymph node recurrence was clinically researched and by ultrasound, in which a second surgical intervention was confirmed by biopsy for lymph node metastasis of the papillary carcinoma group IIA.
Cervical uptake showed consistent imaging of cervical ganglionic lesion persistence of nodular recurrence so that at 9 months post-thyroidectomy it was decided to apply a second dose of iodine 150 mCi with visible ultrasound therapeutic
This lesion has decreased in size in subsequent controls after 1 year 3 months of follow-up and persists with thyroglobulins < 0.5 ng/ml.
