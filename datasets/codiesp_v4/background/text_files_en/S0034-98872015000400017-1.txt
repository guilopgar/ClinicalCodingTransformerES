A 57-year-old woman with a history of chronic constipation.
The patient was hospitalized for pneumonia from July 9 to 11 2014, and was treated with piperacillin-tazodone for 3 days and then with moxifloxacin for 7 days.
Two days after the antibiotic treatment, she presented frequent liquid stools associated with diffuse abdominal pain, fever and hemodynamic compromise. She was hospitalized between July 17 and 23, with a diagnosis of DHF (PCR for vancomycin x 125 mg positive CD 10).
The patient remained asymptomatic until August 4 (4 days post-term of antibiotic treatment) when a new episode of liquid stools with mucus was initiated, associated with abdominal pain ICD10 positive for CD84 hepatitis C.
Two days after the end of antibiotic treatment, the patient restarted liquid stools and abdominal pain. A second episode of CDI recurrence was diagnosed. The patient was treated with oral vancomycin 125 mg every 6 h at a full dose.
7 mg/day of rifampin-containing therapy, 7 mg/day of vancomycin-containing regimens, restarted frequent liquid stools, with abdominal pain and haemodynamic involvement
Given this evolution, with three episodes of recurrence of CDI, two of them requiring treatment and response to antibiotic treatment with slower rifaxi in the last episode, it was decided to perform a family blood donor pathology with hospitalizations on day 2.
Vancomycin and rifaximin were discontinued two days before MPT.
We used 150 g of solid depositions diluted in 500 ml of isotonic saline and subsequently bonded.
The solution was instilled from the terminal ileum to the distal descending colon.
Loperamide 2 mg was prescribed orally every three hours for three times.
The patient was admitted to hospital with digestive symptoms but remained asymptomatic until now (6 months post-FMT) with bowel movements three times a day.
