4-year-old male patient attended the paediatric exploration service.
He had been diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1.
His best corrected visual acuity was 1 in both eyes.
The anterior biomycosis highlighted the bilateral presence of Lisch nodules.
Placement mapping detected that vessels in both eyes had a tortuous configuration along their path and a short-short appearance at their end.
Venovenous anastomosis could also be observed in the superior nasal retina.
No edematous.
Angiographic study was not performed due to the mother's refusal.
