A 74-year-old man with ischemic-hypertensive cardiopathy presented to our hospital with rectal bleeding.
The ulcerated submucosal mass, partially stenosing, was observed at 20 cm from the anal margin.
The opaque enema showed a tumour located in the sigmoid colon.
The abdominal CT only identified a thickening with asymmetric appearance of the distal sigmoid wall, without lymphadenopathy or phasic involvement.
The histological diagnosis obtained by endoscopic biopsies was colon GIST.
Then a laparoscopic sigmoidectomy was performed.
The surgical specimen contained a poorly defined, whitish ulcerated lesion of 45 x 40 mm, with intense positivity for c-kit.
Definitive histological diagnosis was fusocellular colon GIST (c-kit +), with mitotic index < 5/50 high-power fields.
No isolated lymph node was positive for malignancy (0/10).
The asymptomatic patient remains asymptomatic during the follow-up period of 18 months.
