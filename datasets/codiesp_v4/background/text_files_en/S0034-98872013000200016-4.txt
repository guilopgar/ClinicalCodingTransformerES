A 73-year-old male with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis for 3 years.
Five days prior to consultation, the patient presented with oppressive chest pain lasting 2 h.
The pain is repeated briefly during the dialysis session.
ECG showed no significant changes and troponin I reached 23 ng/ml (VN < 0.05 ng/ml).
She was hospitalized in a coronary care unit with a diagnosis of ACS and an invasive coronary study was planned.
The patient reported having used aspirin 5 years earlier, presenting a generalized allergic rash after the first dose, which is accentuated after the next day's dose.
On the third day she presented angioedema and glottic edema, requiring hospitalization for management and suspension of Aspirin.
It was decided to apply a grading protocol without adverse reactions, and the next day coronary angiography was performed showing severe stenosis in the distal right coronary artery and in the middle third of the anterior descending artery.
Angioplasty was performed with stent implantation in both arteries.
The patient evolved without complications and received dual antiplatelet therapy.
At the last follow-up, 4 months after the event, the patient remains in good condition with good adherence to therapy, without angina and without evidence of HAAS.
