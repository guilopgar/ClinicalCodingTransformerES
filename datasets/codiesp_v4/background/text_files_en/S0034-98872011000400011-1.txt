A 52-year-old male patient with a history of hypothyroidism secondary to chronic thyroiditis, Sjögren's syndrome, insulinoresis-tency and generalized vitiligo of approximately 34 years of evolution was treated.
Associated with Sjögren's syndrome, the patient presented a neurological picture interpreted as a chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).
He started treatment with prednisone 1 mg/kg/d in December 2007, which maintained a progressive dose reduction until June 2008.
When this treatment is not successful, patients develop secondary syphilis syndrome.
Therefore, she was presented to the rheumatology team and, considering the failure to corticosteroids, it was decided to initiate monthly IVIG pulses.
During the first two months, immunomodulatory doses (2 g/kg) are used, which then slowly decreased to 0.5 g/kg, and should be increased by 1 reactivation of neuropathy.
Since the first infusion he presented a clear recovery of the neurological picture, which is maintained until now.
After the fourth month of treatment, the patient spontaneously reported a marked decrease in vitiligo with almost total repigmentation of the face, scalp, auricular pavilions, cervical region and feet in about 50% of cases.
This could be objectified by several photographs that the patient had taken on his own initiative before starting treatment.
To date, 28 infusions have been completed, with a monthly maintenance dose of 0.75 gr/kg, almost completely repigmented, with the exception of hands, in which this process has been slower.
