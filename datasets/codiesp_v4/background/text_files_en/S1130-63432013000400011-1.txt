A topical preparation in the form of colistin cream was prescribed to two patients from a Socio-Health Care Center protected by the pharmacy service of a 500-bed university hospital.
After a literature review 1,2,3,4,5, a 0.1%1 colistin formula was prepared following the standards of the National Formulary 2 and according to Standardized Work Procedures6.
Beeler base and water were used in proportions 1:3 as excipients.
Both components were heated separately to facilitate emulsion and subsequently mixed under agitation by adding water to Beeler's base.
Finally, once the cream is prepared, colistin is removed.
The final preparation of 0.1% colistin cream was packaged in a 125 ml topacio bottle.
Due to the need for immediate availability of treatment, a provisional expiry of one month was proposed, pending the results of stability studies.
Nursing professionals were asked to report any change in the preparation.
