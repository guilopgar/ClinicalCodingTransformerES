A 70-year-old woman presented with myodesopsia in her left eye for several weeks.
Visual acuity was 0.8 in the right eye and 0.9 in the left eye.
Intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg in both eyes.
The anterior pole was normal in both eyes.
The eye fundus was normal in the RE.
In the left eye, the patient presented an inferotemporal mass in the caudal plane, with a narrowing color and vascular appearance, without associated hemorrhage or exudates and about three papillary diameters.
The afferent and efferent vessels were not dilated although they had mild tortuosity.
Fluorescence angiography showed a highly vascularized tumor and early hyperfluorescence increased progressively in late phases.
The patient reported no family history of similar problems and the systemic examinations were normal.
The diagnosis of vasoproliferative retinal tumor was established and an expectant attitude was maintained.
The patient was reviewed after six months, without any increase in the size of the tumor or changes in its appearance.
