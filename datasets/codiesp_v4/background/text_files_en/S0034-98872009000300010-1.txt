A 70-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and smoking 20 packs/year, in whom a systemic NHL presented with clinical characteristics of an AAS in its variant descending aorta dissection.
She presented to the emergency service after the onset of acute dorsal pain and dyspnea.
The CT scan revealed the presence of a large soft tissue mass, periaortic, toracoabdominal and a large right pleural effusion, without lymphadenopathies.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was subsequently performed.
She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, where a transesophageal echocardiogram ruled out aortic dissection was performed.
Percentesis was performed, where near 2 hemorrhagic malignant fluid was aspirated, whose cytology revealed NHL compatible cells.
1.
Bone marrow biopsy showed small cell lymphoma, phenotype B. Laparotomy biopsy of the periaortic mass showed low-grade follicular NHL, which led to the diagnosis of PF.
Chemotherapy with CHOP-R was effective, with complete initial resolution of the mass objectified by CT, but then developed chylothorax, malnutrition and died.
