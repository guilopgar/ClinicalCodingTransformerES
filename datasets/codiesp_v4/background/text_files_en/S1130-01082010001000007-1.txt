A 57-year-old male smoker presented with progressive dyspnea without cough or expectoration.
She complained of asthenia, diffuse abdominal pain and constipation of several months duration with a loss of 10 kg. She had tachypnea, hypoventilation of 2/3 of the right lung field and epigastric pain.
A right pleural effusion was observed on chest X-ray.
During her hospital stay, a CT scan showed right pleural thickening with mediastinal lymph nodes, which after performing a pleural biopsy was classified as mesothelioma.
Gastroenteroduodenal transit was performed to complete the study of iron deficiency anemia detected in laboratory tests.
This showed the presence of multiple ulcerated repletion defects in the duodenum.
After this finding an upper digestive endoscopy was requested, visualizing several ulcers in the second duodenal portion with raised and irregular edges that were biopsied.
The sample obtained, after an immunohistochemical study, was described as duodenal obstruction due to malignant neoplasia, considered as mesothelioma.
