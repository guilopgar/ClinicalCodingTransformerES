A 47-year-old male, with a rural residence in the IX region, with no relevant morbid history.
After a low-energy fall, the left lower limb suffered supracondylar fracture.
Radiological study showed trace fracture in pathological bone due to the presence of multiple radiolucent lesions in distal bone compatible with hydatid disease.
Treatment with albendazole was initiated, curettage and excision of cysts with correction of fracture trait was performed.
The pathological study confirmed hydatid etiology.
Four cycles of albendazole evolved with defective consolidation and were performed fifteen months after iliac crest graft.
Abdominal ultrasound and chest X-ray showed no cystic hydatid lesions.
