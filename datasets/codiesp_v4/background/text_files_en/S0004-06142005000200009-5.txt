A 62-year-old patient with mild irritative voiding discomfort, rectal examination not suggestive of neoplasia.
PSAt value was 29.5 ng/ml.
The previous values of total PSA/free PSA/index were 14.2 / authentic and 12.0/ 0.69/ 5.7%, respectively.
The patient had undergone 5 previous sextant biopsies, all negative.
An E-RME was then performed, which showed, in axial and coronal images, the presence of a large hypointense zone at the apex of the central prostatic zone, which in the spectroscopy presented suggestive areas.
Despite having high creatine-choline/citrate levels suggestive of neoplasia, voxels 36 and 45 are of little value since they correspond to the prostatic urethral area.
Voxels 46, 52, and 55 show high citrate curves with lower choline peaks and slightly suggestive indices of neoplasia (75).
In the rest of the graphs, there is a generalized decrease of the metabolites, with sociatic indices of neoplasia, which was confirmed by biopsy of this area.
