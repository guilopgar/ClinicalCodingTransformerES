A 31-year-old man presented with loss of rapid installation forces, initial compromise of lower limbs and progression to upper limbs, determining quadriparesis with cephaloparesis.
Among his antecedents he stood out carrier of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in AIDS stage without fulfillment of the antiretroviral treatment.
She had diarrhea with multiple daily stools during the 10 days prior to consultation.
On admission he was alert, eupneic and apyretic.
She had acceptable hydration status and TA of 110/70 mmHg.
Neuromuscular evaluation showed quadriparesis with cephaloparesis.
K+pl at admission was reported as undetectable, with a urinary K+ value in an isolated sample of 5 mEq/L. He had elevated CK.
Hydroelectrolytic replacement was started with improvement of quadriparesis and normalization of K+pl and CK values.
As in case 1, the severe decrease in plasma potassium was due to an alteration in the external balance due to losses of digestive origin, which is consistent with the K+ value in urine fluid replacement of the first 48 mEq/L.
