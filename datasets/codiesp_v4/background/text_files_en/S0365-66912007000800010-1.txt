A 73-year-old male patient came to the emergency department complaining of pain and redness in his right eye (RE), associated with decreased visual acuity.
Her personal history included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypertensive heart disease and chronic renal failure.
Visual acuity was 0.5 in both eyes.
A good anterior chamber, negative cellular tyndall, pseudophakia and dilatation of episcleral veins were observed in the biomycosis of the right eye.
Intraocular pressure values were normal.
Eye fundus examination showed elevated choroidal lesions of pseudotumoral aspect in the superior temporal quadrant in the RE.
Ultrasound A showed absence of reflectivity and internal vascularization.
Ultrasonography B showed a multilobulated choroidal mass without associated retinal detachment, with absence of echoes in the posterior segment or choroidal detachment.
The axial length of the RE was normal.
GPA showed increased hyperfluorescence without signs of double circulation.
BMU revealed a flat choroidal detachment in 360Â°, as well as normal scleral thickness measurements.
An orbital and sinus MRI was performed, ruling out arteriovenous fistula.
Systemic treatment with steroids was established at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day for one week, with a decrease of 10 mg per week presenting a favorable response in the first week, with progressive decrease of the choroid detachments.
Eight months after the onset of symptoms visual acuity in the RE was 0.8 and in the eye fundus decreased choroidal detachments and the presence of a gap line were observed.
