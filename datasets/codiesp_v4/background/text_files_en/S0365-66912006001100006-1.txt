A 58-year-old woman came to our emergency department complaining of unilateral ocular pain of a few hours of evolution accompanied by some degree of visual acuity decrease.
Physical examination revealed ciliary injection, reactive middle mydriasis and an intraocular pressure of 53 mm Hg.
This picture establishes the presumptive diagnosis of acute attack of narrow-angle glaucoma and proceeds to imaging by BMU and OCT.
OCT showed an angular closing with contact between the trabecular mesh and the most peripheral zone of the iris in the four quadrants.
Similarly, the BMU shows a similar arrangement of the angle at 360Â°.
The corresponding medical treatment was established for later bilateral iridotomies with YAG laser.
After iridotomies, anterior chamber OCT was performed, showing that iridotomy in the eye of acute glaucoma attack is not permeable, and it is necessary to portray the area with new impacts.
After this second treatment, a new OCT is performed which, this time, shows patency of the iridotomy, angle opening and anterior chamber deepening.
