We report the case of a 49-year-old male with HCV genotype 1b hepatopathy.
In 2006, a biopsy showed chronic active hepatitis, METAVIR A2, F2, and viral load (CV) of 117,342 IU/ml.
She received IFN-α and ribavirin with SVR, with normal annual blood tests.
In January 2014, she had abdominal pain, with emphasis on AST 105 U/l, ALT 38 U/l, GGT 105 U/l, and α-FP 45,232 ng/ml.
QoL remained negative.
An ultrasound described a lesion suggestive of CHC (14 x 12.5 cm) that a three-phase computed tomography (CT) confirmed.
The extension study was negative.
Hepatectomy was performed.
The histological study showed HCC (23 cm) with angioinvasion without reaching resection margins.
The rest of the liver showed no inflammatory activity, with expansive portal fibrosis (METAVIR A0, F2).
One month later, the patient presented with α-FP 433 ng/ml and tumor recurrence on CT, and sorafenib was started.
