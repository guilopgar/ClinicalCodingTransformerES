A 78-year-old woman on hemodialysis since 2009 through a left ventricular septal defect (LVEF).
The patient has an arm edema that causes progressive pain and functional impotence.
Diagnosed subclavian vein occlusion with several ATP attempts with early recurrence, it was decided to place a right central venous catheter and close the AVF due to malfunction.
AVF annulation is achieved by ultrasound-guided injection of thrombin into the cephalea with thrombosis.
After 10 days, the edema developed and the patient was asymptomatic.
