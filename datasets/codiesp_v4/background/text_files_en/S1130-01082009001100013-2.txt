A 57-year-old woman with no history of interest presented with intermittent episodes of abdominal pain and diarrhea for 4 months.
The patient did not notice rectal bleeding.
Physical examination showed no significant alterations.
The analytical study showed no alterations.
The patient developed a large polypoid formation in the transverse colon that almost completely occupied the lumen and showed ulcerations in the head.
The site was marked with a clip to better assess the location of the polyp by simple radiography.
Biopsies were taken and reported as: colonic mucosa with signs of ulceration and presence of granulation tissue and fibrous connective tissue, with no evidence of malignancy.
Abdominal CT confirmed the endoscopic findings.
Three weeks later, the patient had to undergo urgent surgery due to a suboptimal condition.
During the intervention, colonic invagination was observed in association with 5.5 cm of submucosal origin.
A right hemicolectomy was performed.
Several lymph nodes were isolated.
