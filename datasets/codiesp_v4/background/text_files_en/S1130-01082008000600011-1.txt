We report the case of a 34-year-old female patient, operated 8 years ago by gastric bypass with antropyloid exclusion, without immediate postoperative complications, who was referred to our unit for transfusion with severe iron deficiency anemia.
The DBE showed normal mucosa of the small intestine up to the anastomosis. The pyloric cavity could be accurately reconstructed without detecting lesions. It could be surpassed to the gastric stump, where an ulcerous lesion was observed.
The papilla was normal in situ.
