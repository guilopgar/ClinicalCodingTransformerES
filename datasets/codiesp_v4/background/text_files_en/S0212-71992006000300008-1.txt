On physical examination, the pulse was irregular at 80 beats/min. Cardiac and abdominal examination were normal.
Chest radiography, basic blood and urine tests and normal axillary temperature.
Medical treatment was established and blood pressure levels were normalized.
A plain abdominal X-ray showed irregular calcification in the left hypochondrium.

On May 3, 1995, a high transverse laparotomy was performed above the loop.
The aneurysm was located in the middle of the splenic artery which was partially lodged in the pancreas and measured 5x5x distal dissection.
Additionally, resection of the tail and part of the body of the pancreas involved in the process were performed.
Associated acycectomy.
Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged 9 days after surgery.
