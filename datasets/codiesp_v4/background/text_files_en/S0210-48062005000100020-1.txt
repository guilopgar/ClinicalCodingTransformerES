This is a 27-year-old male patient, seen in consultation for presenting a painful subcutaneous nodular lesion of approximately 0.3 cm in the dorsal aspect of the penis one year before.
The patient reported increased volume of the lesion with erection, producing a significant increase in pain that prevented him from having sex normally.
Examination revealed a subcutaneous nodule of approximately 4 mm in diameter, of high consistency, near the superficial dorsal vein.
There were no other significant lesions or locoregional lymph nodes and the rest of the urological examination was normal.
Due to the suspicion that it was a lesion of vascular origin, a penile doppler study was requested, which showed intralesional flow, with increased flow during erection, so its removal was proposed.

During the intervention, a nodular dilation was observed in the superficial dorsal vein of the penis, which was partially resected 2 cm proximally and distally to the lesion.

Histological analysis showed the existence of intravascular well-differentiated endothelial cells, with partial obliteration of the vascular lumen, accompanied by a marked lack of proliferation of lymphocytes and eosinophils.
The definitive pathological report was "angiolymphoid hyperplasia with intravascular placement".
