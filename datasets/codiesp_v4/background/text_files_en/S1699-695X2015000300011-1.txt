We report the case of a 40-year-old man with no relevant personal history and no toxic habits.
She came to the primary care clinic due to catarrh and a systolic murmur was detected by chance, so an electrocardiogram (ECG) was requested, finding isolated ventricular extrasystoles.
She was referred to cardiology to complete the study.
Assignment from the cardiological point of view.
Among other complementary tests, cardiologists requested chest X-ray, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (NMR), cardiac Holter monitoring and cardiac computed axial tomography (CAT), finally leading to the diagnosis of left atrial septal defect.
They treat the patient with ramipril 2.5 mg / 24 h, bisoprolol 2.5 mg / 24 h, acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg / 24 h and raise the possibility of surgical correction of the anomaly.
