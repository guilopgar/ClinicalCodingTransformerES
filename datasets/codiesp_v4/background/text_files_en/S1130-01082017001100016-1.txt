Recently, a 43 year old patient underwent ERCP due to colitis.
Horses after it began with abdominal pain in the right hypochondrium and numbness.
Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a subhepatic hematoma measuring 16 x 7 x 16 cm, compressing and displacing the hepatic parenchyma toward the midline.
Subsequently, CT angiography showed no contrast extravasation.
Given the clinical stability and absence of active bleeding, we opted for conservative management with surveillance in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where the patient remained hemodynamically stable.
After ten days, a control CT scan showed persistent collection, so percutaneous drainage was performed, in which 1000 ml of contained was extracted.
The evolution was favorable, and the patient was discharged 12 days later.
However, a new drainage of about 1,100 ml was necessary later, after which the asymptomatic patient became asymptomatic.
