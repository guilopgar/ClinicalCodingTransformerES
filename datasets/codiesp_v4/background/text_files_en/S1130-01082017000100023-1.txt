We report the case of a 42-year-old man diagnosed with this entity, who presented with an acute abdomen of 12 hours after the onset of symptoms.
CT scan showed a right retrohydropneumoperitoneum due to perforation of the duodenal diverticulum extending through the sickle cell ligament.
An exploratory laparotomy showed biliary peritonitis due to perforation of two duodenal diverticula, one with three perforations and another with two.
In the sample referred to Pathological Anatomy, duodenal segments lacking muscularis propria with parietal necrosis were described, confirming the diagnosis.
After the intervention, the evolution was favorable and the patient was discharged a few days later.
