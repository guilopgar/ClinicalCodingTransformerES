A previously healthy 37-year-old man presented with intense abdominal pain initially of the colic type in the left hypochondrium that later became constant in the left flank, without irradiation and without any other associated symptom.
The examination revealed mild abdominal distension.
Despite the analgesic treatment, the patient remained symptomatic and abdominal-pelvis CT was performed, which revealed a hypodense area of cuneiform aspect of the cortex of the lower pole of the left kidney compatible with a renal infarction.
An echocardiogram ruled out the presence of thrombi.
The patient was treated conservatively with angioCT, where the aorta was normal and the distal segment of the left renal artery and its anterior segment were altered, images compatible with arterial fibrodysplasia and renal infarction.
1.
Angiography revealed a fibrodysplastic left renal artery with dissection flap in the lower interlobar branch.
Endovascular maneuvers were not performed.
1.
Thrombophilia tests were normal and good renal function (creatinine clearance 1.0 mg/dl) was verified.
The patient was discharged for outpatient management.
However, the patient did not attend follow-up.
