Severe cutaneous reaction secondary to dopamine occurs when there is extravasation in perivascular tissues, which produces vasoconstriction through its alpha-adrenergic stimulating effect.
When extravasation occurs and the adjacent tissue is devitalized, phenobarbital may be administered as an alpha-adrenergic blocker31.
In our patient, it was not used due to the time elapsed and good spontaneous evolution32.
It is important to consider the differential diagnoses that, if not suspected and treated, can cause death of the patient.
Among these diagnoses it is necessary to consider the infectious complications of the umbilical cord.
