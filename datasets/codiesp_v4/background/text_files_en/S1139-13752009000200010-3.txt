A 28-year-old patient diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus associated with vasculitis.
In August 2007, the patient was admitted due to fever and impaired renal function.
One month later, the patient was readmitted with significant systemic activation.
The patient was treated with plasmapheresis for hemolytic uremic syndrome associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.
In October of that same year, he started a regular hemodialysis program, performing AVF.
At these dates she presented a significant deterioration of her general condition, with edema and fever syndrome.
Despite treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the outcome has not been good from the point of view of renal injury.
Treatment due to severe diarrhea was reduced, with cytomegalovirus appearing in the control laboratory tests.
In order not to increase the chance of infection with medication, granulocytapheresis treatment is started.
Five sessions were performed, 1 each week, using the vascular access via a catheter in the right jugular.
The patient had no complications during the treatment.
His general condition improved markedly, disappearing diarrhea and negativizing the presence of cytomegalovirus in PCR.
Currently, she receives three dialysis sessions per week and her condition is asymptomatic, afflicted and without recovery of renal function.
