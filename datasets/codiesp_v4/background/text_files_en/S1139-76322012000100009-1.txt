We present the case of two brothers, an eight year old boy and a five year old girl.
These are two healthy children who consult because, in the evening before the child and the child, they have presented three times, involuntary, rectal examination of a substance and did not have general symptoms of vomiting or abdominal pain tomorrow.
1.
Both children, like their father, had supper butterfish on the board the night before the onset of symptoms: the child approximately 20 hours, and almost the day and a half before the child (30 hours approximately).
It was the first time they consumed it and the father had no symptoms.
The child had taken about 160 g, and the father and the boy had taken about 250 g.
Initially, a stool analysis was programmed, but after consulting the literature, telephone contact was established with the family to inform about the benignity of the condition and the non-need for feces studies.
In controls after four and eight days, both children and father remained asymptomatic.
