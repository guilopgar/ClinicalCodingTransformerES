A 55-year-old female patient was referred for oral examination.
The patient's family and personal history included a medical history compatible with tuberous sclerosis (calcifications compatible with CT and facial angiofibromas).
There are no other relevant medical history.
The patient has multiple facial lesions, previously diagnosed as "sebaceous adenomas".
In the oral examination there are multiple lesions, about 3-6 mm in greater diameter, distributed in the buccal mucosa and internal lip.
Some of the lesions presented exophytic growth, sessile and normal coloration of the mucosa; others were nodules, with aspect compatible with accumulation of mucoid material.
The patient had not previously consulted due to these lesions, which were asymptomatic, and did not remember seizures.
She had no other intraoral lesion and advanced edentulism, according to her history of torpid caries.
A presumptive diagnosis of multiple fibromatosis associated with the underlying disease (TD) was made and two samples of the internal labial mucosa and left jugular mucosa were taken for histopathological study.
The histological result of both lesions, by study with hematoxylin-eosin, was angiomyolipoma.
Immunohistochemical study was performed for HMB-45 and m-actin, both negative.
Given the asymptomatic of the lesions and the anatomopathological result, it was recommended to have periodic controls as it did with the other signs of the disease.
