We present a previously healthy 2-year-old boy who was admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit derived from the pediatric ward after ingestion of approximately 50 ml of amitraz (520 mg/kg).
Initially, cutaneous manifestation was performed, along with gastric lavage, active ingredient and purging salt.
Upon admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable with respiratory pauses, myopic pupil and sensory impairment (Glasgow Coma Scale 8/15), so intubation was decided.
The chest X-ray (black), neither at admission nor during its evolution, showed any signs compatible with aspiration pneumonia.
During his stay in the MRA, continuous sedation was not administered and his progressive neurological recovery could be verified.
Due to symptomatic bradycardia (decrease in heart rate from 120 to 60 beats per minute) with evidence of poor peripheral perfusion, atropine was indicated, which was administered on two consecutive occasions and at a dose of 0.01 mg.
Elective extubation was performed 24 hours after admission with good outcome.
There was no alteration of any other parenchyma with laboratory values within normal for age.
