The chest X-ray showed condensation in the left base without bronchogram, suspecting a lung neoplasia, so a thoracic CAT scan showed intrathoracic ectopic left kidney with a left hemidiaphragmatic segmental hernia lobe originating good segments.
Fiberoptic bronchoscopy at left base in segment six and posterior segments of the basal pyramid showed signs of compression practiced at this level alveolar broncho-aspirated with absence of cells.
