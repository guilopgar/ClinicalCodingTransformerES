We describe the case of a 49-year-old male with no relevant personal history except for hysterectomy after 22 years due to a traffic accident.
In an outpatient study due to suspicion of lumbosacral herniation, there seems to be some posterior kidney tissue caused by lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding a mass of the left renal blade over the left perirenal space.
With the initial suspicion of an incidentally diagnosed renal mass, we requested a multislice abdominal-pelvic CT with intravenous contrast which confirms the existence of a mass of 4.7 x 2.2 cm in the left renal non-reactual fat mass.

Given the CT findings and the history of cystectomy, the diagnostic suspicion of sarcoidosis was high.
In any case, we chose to complete the diagnosis by requesting a 99mTc-labelled hepatosplenic gammagraphy with septate vesicles and syncytosis which confirms the existence of two theoretical foci 6 cm, compatible with perirenal location.

After reviewing the related literature, and given that the patient was asymptomatic, we opted for therapeutic abstention.
