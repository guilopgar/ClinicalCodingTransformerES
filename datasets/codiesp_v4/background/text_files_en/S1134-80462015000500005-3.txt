A 35-year-old woman presented with a two-year history of pruritic lesion in the back.
She complained of continuous pruritus in the right scapular region, but did not require any treatment because she described it as tolerable.
In the objective examination, the rest of the dorsal zone presents hyperpigmentation zone, and in a wider area the pinch is located around the hyperpigmented zone, where more hyperesthesia is observed.
In the complementary tests performed, a total spinal MRI showed a central dyscal hernia C5-C6 that contacted the spinal cord without displacing it.
No symptomatic treatment was required either.
