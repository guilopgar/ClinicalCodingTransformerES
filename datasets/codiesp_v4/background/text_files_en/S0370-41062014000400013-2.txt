An 8-year-old female student consulted with her mother for a burning sensation in the genital and perineal area associated with a white secretion, without bad odor, daily for approximately two weeks.
She had a history of an anogenital cleft from an infant period that was kept under observation for a short period without completing the follow-up until discharge.
The patient performed her genital cleaning daily only with water presented on two occasions scarce bleeding when dry the perineal area.
No history of urinary infection, constipation or pubic development.
Upon examination, the patient was eutrophic, with breasts and mucosensitive hair, Tanner I. A redundant, red hymen was observed in the genital examination, as well as a groove from the tvulsa to the lumen.
A perineal groove associated with nonspecific vulvovaginitis was diagnosed.
Samples were taken for vaginal culture with commensal flora.
Resection of the groove was suggested, but the family decided to perform a therapeutic test with topical lumps, since it understood the character of the lesion.
