A 76-year-old patient was admitted to the Surgery Department due to anemia, ascites, generalized weakness, neurologically stuporous and a prolapsed and irreducible rectal mass.
The patient has presented mucosal diarrhea, rectal bleeding and rectal bleeding for years.
Physical examination revealed a prolapsed and incarcerated rectal mass measuring 10 cm in length that secreted a lot of mucus.
Analytically, the patient was anemic with hemoglobin 6 g/dl, hematocrit 18 %, and data of acute renal failure (urea 158 mg/dl, creatinine 1.94 mg/dl), hyponatremic and hypokalemic 2.6 mEq/dl.
Emergency abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a large prolapsed rectal mass, ascites and multiple liver metastases some of them necrotic.
Due to the intense pain caused by the prolapsed tumor and the anal with profuse palliative resection and rectal bleeding, the patient underwent surgery, after correction of renal failure, performing one.
The patient died 24 hours after surgery due to cardiorespiratory complications.
