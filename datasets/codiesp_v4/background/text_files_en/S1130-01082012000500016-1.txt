An 83-year-old patient with no history of occult gastrointestinal bleeding underwent CE.
His readout revealed stenosis.
Eight days after ingestion, the patient came to the emergency room with an 8-hour history of intestinal closure.
Analytical: 9,400 leukocytes/Î¼l, hemoglobin: 11.2 g/dl, platelets and coagulation were normal.
Abdominal radiography: dilated small bowel loops and artifact corresponding to CE.
Computed tomography : complete mechanical intestinal obstruction secondary to FB.
Emergency surgery was indicated, as well as placement of a distal abdominal loop of the intestine proximal to 4 of the ileum with inflammatory appearance, one of them causing complete obstruction, in which the stenosis was located.
Thirty centimeters of the ileum were resected, including 3 of the 4 strictures. Mechanical side-to-side anastomosis and stricturoplasty of the remaining stenosis were performed.
The postoperative course was favorable and the patient was discharged on day 7.
The histological result of the specimen was Crohn's disease.
