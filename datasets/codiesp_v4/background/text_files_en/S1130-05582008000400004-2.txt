In 1987, a 43-year-old patient, the elder son of patient #1, was admitted to our service of oral and maxillofacial surgery with a large tumor of the left jaw.
1.
The tumor had occurred 11 years before, when the patient lived elsewhere in the country, and was diagnosed in the local hospital as an ossifying fibroma.
High levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone were detected at the same time.
A parathyroid adenoma was resected.
Since then, the mandibular tumor continued to grow and the patient was treated several times with radiotherapy and curettage.
When seen for the first time in our service, the patient had a vesicular tumor of the left jaw with osteonecrosis and infection, as well as two smaller masses in the left maxilla and mandible.
He also showed painful left blindness caused by radiotherapy and incipient renal failure.
1.
Left eye enucleation and left hemimandibulectomy were performed; reconstruction was not performed due to the presence of local infection.
The resected tumor (13x18 cm) was an ossifying fibroma.
1.
Five years later, right hemimandibulectomy with reconstruction using 2 rib grafts was performed; the histopathological diagnosis of the right tumor was the same.
The patient died 3 years later due to complications of renal failure, despite being treated with hemodialysis since 1990.
