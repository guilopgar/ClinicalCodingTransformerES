A 7-day-old girl with a prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of a tumor in the retrorectal region.
At week 35 of gestation an ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous retrorectal image of 28 x 19 x 17 mm (volume 4.9 cm3) with absence of Doppler flow inside.
A CT scan confirmed the existence of a presacral cyst on the day of life.
With presumptive clinical diagnosis of cystic teratoma or intestinal duplication surgical excision was performed through a posterior sagittal subcoxygeal approach.
Eighteen months after surgery, the patient had no complications.
The macroscopic study revealed a renitent formation, 3 cm in diameter, which at the cutting presented a unilocular cystic cavity with pasty content.
Histological examination revealed relapsed due to squamous epithelium and urothelial epithelium.
A layer of smooth muscle with disorganized bundles constituted the cyst wall.
