A 50-year-old woman with a history of left radical nephrectomy for renal adenocarcinoma 10 years ago, who came from the Neurology Service for presenting right nasal respiratory failure of two months of evolution accompanied by hyposmia, paranasal pain.
The patient had recently been subjected to control by the Urology Department where there was no evidence of disease.
Nasal endoscopic examination showed the existence of a polypoid, pulsatile, red wine-red and elastic to the atom located in the right nasal fossa, which seemed to come from the ipsilateral maxillary sinus.
Cranial CT and contrast-enhanced paranasal sinuses were performed, which reported the existence of neoformation resembling the right nasal fossa and a large maxillary sinus with a slight contrast.
The study was completed with maxillary cranial arteriography that showed the hypervascularized character of the tumor.
Biopsy is then taken under general anesthesia after selective embolization of the tumor by Coils.
The final pathological study showed a lesion lining the respiratory epithelium with changes in the squamous epithelium and ulcerated areas and fibrin deposits with honeycombing, showing a solid alveolar adenocarcinoma proliferation axis compatible with clear cytoplasmic cells.
We review the extension studies confirming the single metastasis of the disease at the nasal level.

Surgical treatment is proposed to the patient, but she refuses to be referred to the emergency department for treatment with interferon, which is complemented with radiotherapy.
