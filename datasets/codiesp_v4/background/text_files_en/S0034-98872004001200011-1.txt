Male, 45 years old, right-handed, with no morbid history.
She suddenly noticed difficulty in detecting objects that appeared on the right and behind her head.
In his clinical evaluation he had a normal general and neurological examination, with a visual acuity of 20/20 in each eye and symmetric pupils without afferent or efferent defects.
However, the confrontation campimetry study showed a lateral temporal field defect of the right eye.
Goldmann perimeter of the right eye showed a peripheral defect extending between 60o and 90o of the horizontal meridian.
The visual field of the left eye was normal, extending to 90o temporal and 60o nasal.
The eye fundus was normal in both eyes.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a hyperintense lesion in the FLAIR sequence in the anterior region of the left occipital cortex.
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed a decrease in peak choline, creatine and N-acetyltransferase levels, as well as an increase in peak lactate levels, compatible with infarction.
The etiopathogenic study of the infarction was negative.
Aspirin was prescribed at a dose of 325 mg/day and stable for 6 months after consultation.
MRI and control MR spectroscopy at 6 months showed no changes from baseline.
