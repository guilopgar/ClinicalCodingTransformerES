We report the case of a 60-year-old man diagnosed with incidental renal mass compatible with renal carcinoma in the lower pole of the right kidney of 5x5cm, with negative extension study to which a radical nephrectomy of renal cells was performed.
1.
Five years after the intervention the dermologist consulted for a cutaneous lesion in the left parietal area of progressive growth of nodular erythematous appearance with some zones with discretely pediculate base of six months of evolution.
Rebanding and electrocoagulation are performed when capillary angioma versus botryomycosis is suspected.
The histological diagnosis reveals epidermal detachment due to a low cytological grade renal cell carcinoma compatible with metastasis of primary renal cell, so the exeresis is completed.
At 7 months she presents multiple foci of hypernephroma in the left kidney and nodules in the pancreas evolving in the following months to a progressive neurological deterioration caused by multiple metastatic lesions in the brain predetermined as well as increase of cutaneous metastases.
