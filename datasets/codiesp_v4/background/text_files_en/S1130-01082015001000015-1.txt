We report the case of a 47-year-old woman with no history of interest, who consulted for abdominal pain in the left iliac fossa for months without other symptoms.
Abdominal ultrasound identified a liver of conserved size with multiple rounded images in both liver lobes suggestive of uncomplicated angiomas, although it draws attention one located in the edge of the left lobe and another heterogeneous angioma left.
associated with these findings, the patient was referred to our Hepatobiliopancreatic Surgery and Hepatic Transplant Consultations, where it was decided to complete the study with a three-phase CT angiomas with a narrow ligament in which
To characterize this lesion, abdominal MRI is performed and may correspond to a desmoid tumor, primary or secondary peritoneal tumor.
With this radiological diagnosis, a surgical intervention was performed, in which a small ligament and angioma measuring about 10 cm in diameter in segments VI-VII was found, together with numerous bilobar angiomas.
The ligament was removed requesting intraoperative biopsy, which confirmed the benignity of the lesion, and segmentectomy VI-VII with electrocoagulation.
The patient had a good subsequent evolution and was discharged on the fourth postoperative day without incidents.
Definitive pathologic anatomy confirms the presence of hepatic hemangioma and leiomyoma of the ligament.
