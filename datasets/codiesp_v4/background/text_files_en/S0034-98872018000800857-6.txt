A 62-year-old, right-handed, hypertensive and smoking woman presented with dysarthria and weakness of the left hemibody for 2 h.
The patient was admitted with a NIHSS (Institutional of Health Stroke) index, with normal brain CT.
Intravenous thrombolysis was indicated, suspended by epistaxis.
The immediate brain CT angiography allowed the definition of occlusion in the M1 segment of the right MCA.
Mechanical thrombectomy was performed, achieving satisfactory revascularization (TICI 3).
On the third day he kept his eyes closed, apparently asleep, stimulated, trying to open his eyes without achieving it.
He was oriented.
Mechanical elevation of eyelids showed normal voluntary and reflex oculomotility.
The next day, an asymmetric and impersistent ocular opening was observed, with ptosis greater than left.
CCP appeared on the ninth day with complete and persistent opening.
