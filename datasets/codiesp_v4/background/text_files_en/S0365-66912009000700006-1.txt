An 80-year-old woman, not known at the service, presented with traumatic pain in her left eye (LE).
Among its antecedents we highlight recurrent conjunctivitis in childhood, senile arthrosis and 4 healthy children.
Examination revealed corneal abrasion in the left eye, which was cured with occlusion and epithelizing ointment within 1 week.
In addition, in both eyes (AO) there is an atrophic iris, folded, folded with inferior gonioscopy, more in OI and a reduction of the anterior chamber visible also in the anterior chamber.
He has ocular tension figures of 24 mm Hg. in OA, with a visual field (Humphrey 30-2) with a general reduction in sensitivity.
When the eye fundus was located, hyperpigmented and atrophic lesions were found.
With the presumptive diagnosis of congenital syphilis, even without leucomas characteristic of old interstitial collagenosis, we requested diagnostic tests for syphilis, obtaining positive results in treponemic tests (TPHA, FTAR non-treponemal).
At this point the patient is evaluated by internal medicine and mulattos who ignore the real cause of their conjunctivitis, although they report in detail: the treatments received at 9 years of age, in full preanesthetic weekly.
Medical history findings were compatible with late congenital syphilis, with interstitial scarring successfully treated, as it lacks leucomas.
Acquired by placental infection: mother with severe arthropathy compatible with secondary syphilis.
And cured by negative result in RPR test.
