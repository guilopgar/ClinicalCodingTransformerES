A 52-year-old man, with no relevant medical history, no toxic habits, has been working as a welder for fifteen years in a small mechanical workshop dedicated mainly to the repair and installation of different metal wax structures.
Most welding processes used are MIG (metal inert gas)/ MAG (metal active gas), the gas used is a mixture of argon and carbon dioxide.
She came to an Ophthalmology Department because she has had loss of vision for several months.
In exploration, the following results are obtained:
The biomicroscopic study showed that the crystalline lens, cornea and anterior chamber of both eyes were normal.
Eye tension is within normal limits.
The central visual acuity is 0.25 in the right eye and 0.9 in the left eye.
Self-limiting lesions and self-fluorescence images of both eyes revealed chronic foveal and foveal vasoconstriction with an accumulation of pigment (lipofucsin)
1.
In the study of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) of both eyes, loss of epithelium and retinal pigmentosa is detected at foveolar and reflex level.
1.
The diagnostic orientation is bilateral chronic maculopathy (due to ultraviolet radiation), despite medical treatment, for 18 months with lutein and antioxidants, the patient worsens his right visual acuity of 0.1 at present.
Because the company cannot replace it in 10 other jobs, it is classified as a permanent disability due to occupational disease, since chronic maculopathy is classified within the framework of Decree 1299/2006.
