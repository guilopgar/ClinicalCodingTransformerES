A 23-year-old female patient attended the stomatology and oral surgery unit of the Faculty of Dentistry of the University of Cartagena for presenting a midline tumor between the middle and posterior third of the dorsal tongue.
The presence of the tumor was confirmed from birth, which was evolving and increasing in size.
Extraoral physical examination revealed a collaborating patient with good nutritional status, vital signs and general physical appearance within normal limits.
She denied relevant family and personal history regarding the reason for consultation.
Intraoral examination showed a tumor in the midline between the middle and posterior third of the dorsal aspect of the tongue of 2x3 cm, pedunculated base, consistency cauceous vessels, asymptomatic superficial mucosa covering translucent.
With the clinical impression of tongue and differential diagnosis with lingual thyroid, laboratory tests (gammagraphy with iodine 99) are performed to determine the position and function of the thyroid gland, thus ruling out the presence of thyroid.

Excisional biopsy was performed under peritumoral local anesthesia and a wedge-shaped incision at the base of the pediculae was made, with 4-0 silk suture.
The procedure was well tolerated without complications; amoxicillin 500 mg one capsule every 8 hours for 7 days and acetaminophen 500 mg tablets every 6 hours for 5 days were prescribed.
The sample is sent to histopathological study confirming the diagnosis.
Postoperative controls were performed at 8, 15, 30 days, 3, 6, 12 months, 2, 3, 5 years without evidence of recurrence.
