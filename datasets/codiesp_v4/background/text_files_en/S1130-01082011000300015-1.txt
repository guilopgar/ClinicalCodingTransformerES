We report a new case of spontaneous vaginal discharge in a post-menopausal woman.
We report the case of a 77-year-old woman with a history of vaginal hysterectomy 13 years before, who came to the emergency department due to the exit of small bowel loops through the vagina for 1 hour after a laughter attack at home.
On physical examination, congenital malformations of approximately 1 meter of the small intestine appear congestively through the vagina. Emergency surgery is indicated.
Emergency surgery is performed jointly with a combined abdominal and vaginal approach.
An infraumbilical midline laparotomy showed an open vaginal dome through the introduction of the small intestine and small intestine, corresponding to the ileum.
The small intestine is reduced to the abdominal cavity, proving its viability and closing the vaginal defect with irreabsorbable material.
A Dual Mesh mesh is used to reinforce vaginal suture and close the peritoneum of the Douglas bag bottom.
The postoperative period was satisfactory and the patient was discharged 5 days after surgery.
Six months after surgery the patient remains asymptomatic.
