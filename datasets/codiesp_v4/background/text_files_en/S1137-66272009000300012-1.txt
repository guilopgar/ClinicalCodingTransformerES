Patient of 3 4/12a of age, African origin (Mali).
Resident in Navarre for 4 months.
She had been admitted from Primary Care to the Pediatric Nephrology consultation due to an intermittent hematuria of 6 months evolution.
Among the diagnostic tests that were performed we mention the study of renal function that was normal, as well as four determinations of urinary sediment that were negative.
Renovesical ultrasound was also normal.
Blood tests showed platelet count: 6.100,000 mm3, hemoglobin: 13.6 g/dL, hematocrit: 1.6 % MCV: 134, 6% MCH: 22.3 mm, leukocyte count: 32.8 pg/dL.
At this time, the outpatient consultation of the Pediatric ontology was performed due to anemia without filiation and suspicion of thalassemic trait.
Once in our consultation, in view of the normality of the tests previously performed and when it was observed that the blood analysis was not suggestive of a thalassemic trait, the anamnesis was redone.
As we mentioned earlier, he emphasized that this was a family of African origin and that the father reported that his other child had similar symptoms, with urine collection.
The suspicion that it was a schistosomiasis was preferentially requested a urine sediment indicating the microbiologist who insisted on the search for schistosomes.
Subsequently, the laboratory confirmed the presence of S. haematobium eggs in the urinary sediment, together with Balantidium coli intestinal protozoo, without pathogenic significance in this parasitosis.

A few hours after the outcome was known, treatment with Praziquantel at 20 mgr/Kg/dose was initiated orally, a total of 4 doses, in a single day.
The response was favorable.
The child was subsequently monitored in outpatient clinics and urinary symptoms disappeared.
