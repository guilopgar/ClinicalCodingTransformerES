A 76-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease was admitted to our clinic for an indurated lesion in the left genial region.
A facial CT scan showed a rounded morphology of the skin and subcutaneous cellular tissue, and an incisional biopsy showed dermatofibrosarcoma prorans.
Treatment consisted of excision of the lesion with margins including skin and muscles of the left genial region.

The defect was closed filled with a Bichat ball mobilized to provide volume and a cervicofacial rotation flap for skin coverage.
The buccal commissure was achieved by means of an autologous fascia graft, whose ends were placed on the upper lip and then separated from the temporalis tendonoid bone.
Five months after surgery an acceptable aesthetic result is observed, and how the patient can raise the labial commissure.
