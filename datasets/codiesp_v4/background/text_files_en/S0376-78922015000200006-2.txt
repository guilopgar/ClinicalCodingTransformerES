A 53-year-old patient with a history of uterine and ovarian carcinoma with abdominal wall, retroperitoneal lesion and incisional hernia on recurrent ulceration.
The patient was treated by the Gastrointestinal Surgery Service, performing extended local surgical resection of the abdominal wall lesion, resection of the retroperitoneal lesion and repair of the defect of the fascia with mesh.
We received the patient after this procedure with a defect from the partial donor site to hypogastric skin of 24 x 13 cm. We proceeded to its coverage with an anterolateral thigh flap and pedicle grafts.
As in the previous case, we performed transposition of the flap below the anterior rectum.
