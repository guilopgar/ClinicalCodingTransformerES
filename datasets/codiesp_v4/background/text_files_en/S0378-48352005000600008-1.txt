A 54-year-old patient who, during a routine gynecologic examination, was discovered by ultrasound a 6 cm tumor of maximum sleepy diameter, homogeneous and poorly defined in its posterior contours, since there is no circumscribed gray image.
This mass was confirmed by CT in which a rounded, well-defined lesion of about 6 cm in diameter was observed, which showed predominantly fatty absorption coefficients with slight heterogeneity, all of which is compatible with a possible tumor.
This patient had hematocrit figures of 38% without accompanying alterations.
No visceromegaly was observed.
Macroscopically, it was a well-defined, irregular tumor of 7x5x3 cm that seemed to be essentially constituted by other fibrolantic adipose tissue, such as a central hemorrhagic area of 2 cm, peripheral edema, a series of areas
1.
Histologically, the neoplasm was relatively well circumscribed and consisted of mature adipose tissue, loose connective tissue and mixed hematopoietic cellularity.
The latter component predominated in the central areas of the tumor and was represented by the three hematopoietic series (megakaryocytic, red series and white series), with different proportions according to the zone studied and with a 1:11 index.
Megakaryocytic was easily observed and although occasional immature forms were found, they did not present dysplastic features.
The stroma of hematopoietic areas was almost exclusively adipose-type.
In the peripheral zone of the tumor, mature adipose tissue was predominant, with a focus on fibrosis and abundant vesicles.
Lipoblasts or bizarre mesenchymal cells were not observed and there was some inflammatory component with lymphocyte predominance, occasionally arranged in random distribution aggregates in both hematopoietic and adipose areas.
