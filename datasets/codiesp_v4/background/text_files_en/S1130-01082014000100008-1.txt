This is an asymptomatic 61-year-old male who participates in the colorectal cancer screening program in our autonomous community.
After being positive the occult blood test is subjected to feces which cannot be completed due to poor tolerance to the examination.
Performing the established protocol, a CT colonography was performed, in which no colonic pathology was observed, but multiple mesenteric adenopathies were observed.
A subsequent positron emission tomography (PET-CT) described multiple nodular images with increased metabolism.
In this context, when a lymphoproliferative process is diagnosed, a midgut study was conducted with endoscopic video capsule showing multiple polyp lesions with a whitish appearance located mostly in the small intestine and small intestine.
Lesions located more distally are more abigarated, larger and some of them present fibrinoid ulcerations.
The appearance of these lesions, as described in the literature, is very suggestive of a lymphoproliferative process of the small intestine (1).
The samples obtained by enteroscopy and puncture of an adenopathy with radiological control confirmed the diagnosis of a follicular lymphoma stage IIA.
