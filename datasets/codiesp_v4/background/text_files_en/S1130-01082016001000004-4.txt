A 2-year-old girl with esophageal stenosis secondary to caustic ingestion did not respond after 7 consecutive dilatation balloon dilatation dilations.
The stenosis was 1 cm in length and an initial caliber of 2 mm. Two sessions of intralesional injection of mitomycin C (1.6 ml each time) and dilation with balloons of 10-11-12 mm were performed, obtaining complete resolution 40 days.
Two years and five months have passed since ingestion and has not required new esophageal dilations in the last 19 months.
