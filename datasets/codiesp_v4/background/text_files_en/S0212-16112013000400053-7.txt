A 52-year-old male with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction treated with chemotherapy.
Subsequently, a total gastrectomy extended to the esophagus and post-surgery radiochemotherapy were performed.
During this process he maintained good nutritional status with dietary modifications and the use of supplements.
A few months after the end of treatment, the patient developed severe and very rapid loss of consciousness with a body mass index (BMI) of 14.5 kg/m2.
Tumor recurrence was ruled out and SNY was placed for EN (allowing oral intake ad libitum), which was maintained at home until the patient reached a BMI of 19 kg/m2 and adequate oral intake.
Two months after the catheter was removed, the patient was diagnosed with chronic radiation arthritis/yeyunitis.
After performing cystectomy, NE with progressive recovery was restarted.
Currently the patient has a BMI of 24 kg/m2 and is in the withdrawal phase of HEN.
Table I shows the complications associated with catheters and terminals, the way complications were resolved, as well as their length of stay and the reason for the ENT.
