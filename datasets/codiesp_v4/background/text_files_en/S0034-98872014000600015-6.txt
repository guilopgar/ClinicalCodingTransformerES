Female, 67 years old.
Four years before admission, a right breast cancer was diagnosed.
She presented with abdominal pain, nausea, bilateral lower limb edema and oliguria.
There was renal failure, bilateral hydronephrosis and increased density of retroperitoneal tissue, consistent with PKF.
We tried unsuccessfully to install ureteral catheters, nephrostomy was performed that worked defectively and entered hemodialysis.
Retroperitoneal biopsy was not performed due to its general conditions and prednisone was prescribed.
The patient died in the hospital 6 weeks after admission.
