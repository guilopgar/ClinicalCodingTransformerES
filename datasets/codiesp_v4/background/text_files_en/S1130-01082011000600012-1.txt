A 66-year-old woman with epigastric pain for 15 days without other symptoms.
Abdominal ultrasound showed liver abscess in segments II and IV, with a maximum diameter of 10 cm. CT scan showed a metallic foreign body inside the collection, probably a needle.
Emergency intervention was decided for drainage and removal of the foreign body, finding a perforation at the level of the anterior gastric surface that requires simple suture.
The pathological anatomy clarifies the origin of the foreign body, since it is not a needle, but a bone, probably from the chicken that the patient had previously ingested accidentally.
