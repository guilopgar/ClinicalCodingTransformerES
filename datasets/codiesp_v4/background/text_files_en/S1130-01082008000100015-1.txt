A 40-year-old patient, followed by endometriosis, presented epigastric abdominal pain, asthenia, decay, polyuria and edema related to the ovarian hormonal cycle.
A review found elevated tumor markers (ACE: 4 ng/ml and Ca 19.9: 119.7/Uml).
An oral endoscopy found thickened gastric folds that displaced en bloc on biopsy, which was reported as chronic superficial gastritis with foveolar hyperplasia associated with the presence of Helicobacter pylori.
The study was completed with abdominal CT and MRI, which confirmed the presence of gastritis, without ruling out any other etiology.
1.
persistence of tumor markers elevated endoscopy taking macrobiopsy demonstrated the existence of gastric adenocarcinoma extension T2N0.
Total gastrectomy R0D2 was performed.
Histopathology detailed that it was a poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma of diffuse type, with transmural extension reaching serosa and mesogastrium.
Metastasis in lymph nodes with greater and lesser curvature (30/37).
Chronic antrum-body gastritis associated with Helicobacter pylori and localized mixed type gastropathy (localised Menetrier's disease).
