A 71-year-old male presented with a history of secondary implantation of a right eye IOL (OD) and left eye cataract surgery (LE).
As antecedent, the patient presented with aphakia of OD trauma 25 years ago, which motivated the extraction of traumatic cataract intra.
In the exploration, the patient presented a better corrected visual acuity of the unit, in the Snellen scale, for the right eye, and counting fingers in left eye.
Biomicroscopy showed peripheral iridectomy at 12 hours, vitreous anterior chamber and aphakia.
Corneal transparency was at 360o at that time, and the patient was asymptomatic.
The OI had a cataract NO4-P4-C1.
The rest of the exploration was normal.
In the first intervention, a phacoemulsification of OI was performed with implantation of posterior chamber IOL under topical anesthesia.
The postoperative course was uneventful and the best corrected visual acuity one month after surgery.
In a second course with anterior cruciateectomy with implant biconvex anterior chamber of +18.5 diopters in RE (STORZ, 121UV, PPMA, SN:2Y normal).
Two months after the intervention the patient had a better corrected visual acuity of the unit, finding the anterior chamber IOL perfectly centered.
Two years after surgery, the patient developed peripheral corneal edema with microbullae respecting the visual axis and brownish central endothelial pigmentation in his right eye.
The central pachymetry was 520 Î¼m.
Central endothelial count with specular coherence was 1,246 cells/mm2.
A 5% sodium chloride ointment was introduced.
On the other hand, OI did not present corneal, peripheral or central edema seven years after the intervention.
