We present a 30-year-old male patient who consulted for abdominal pain in the Emergency Department of Hospital San José, Santiago de Chile.
Physical examination revealed a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa.
Also noteworthy is the persistence of the right testis.
Ultrasound showed a heterogeneous mass suggesting an encapsulated abscess.
It is complemented by computed axial tomography in which the presence of a solid mass of approximately 10 x 8 x 7 cms is observed, occupying the flank and the right iliac fossa.
The presence of extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathies and mesentery is also observed.
The chest X-ray was normal.
Tumor markers only reveal a slight increase in the beta subunit of chorionic gonadotropin (ß-HCG).
The patient underwent laparotomy confirming the diagnosis of an intraabdominal testicular tumor.
Resection was performed without incidents.
Histopathological analysis was compatible with testicular cancer, classic seminoma histological type.
The weight was 516 grams and the size of the tumor was 14.5 x 9.5 x 6.5 cm.
She also presented focal involvement of the epididymis and tunica albuginia.
Postoperative tumor markers were within normal ranges.
The patient was referred for Chemotherapy.
