An 11-year-old patient complained of pain in the right lower limb after a trauma to the cheek of a piscine.
Physical examination revealed edema and intense pain due to palpation of the distal pretibial area.
She has stable support, with mild lameness for walking.
An X-ray of the tibia and fibula was requested, which identified an oval cortical lytic lesion with sclerotic borders in the distal area of the right tibia, compatible with cortical fibrous defect.
Conservative treatment is indicated, showing a satisfactory evolution, with progressive cessation of symptoms.
