A 49-year-old homosexual male patient with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis in childhood treated with streptomycin, recent lateral sphincterotomy due to anal fissure and centinela, positive serology diagnosed in January 2003, with stage C3 pneumonia.
Last control CD 30 and 2.220,000 viral copies.
Treatment with lamivudine-zithromycin is initiated.
She complained of severe post-pandrial epigastric pain without heartburn.
Physical examination revealed raised red-violaceous lesions in the left laterocervical and right inguinal areas, greater than 2 cm in maximum diameter.
An oral endoscopy showed erythematous lesions in the stomach and first duodenal portions, some of them ulcerated with positive biopsy for Kaposi's sarcoma.
Negative extension study, with normal abdominal CT scan.
With the diagnosis of kaposi's sarcoma with visceral and cutaneous involvement, treatment with liposomal adriamycin 20 mg/m2 is started every 3 weeks.
Since the first cycle of treatment, cutaneous involvement disappears and the patient remains asymptomatic. Oral endoscopy was repeated on the third cycle, showing complete resolution of the lesions.
