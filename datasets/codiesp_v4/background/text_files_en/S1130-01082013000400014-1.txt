A 78-year-old woman presented with a 4-month history of hematochezia without other symptoms.
Painful right hemiabdomen stands out due to palpation, without masses, iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin 6.6 g/dl and transfer saturation index 4 %) and normal carcinoembryonic antigen.
Gastroscopy does not reveal potentially bleeding lesions.
In the gastrointestinal transit, a doubtful contrast-enhanced defect in the last ileal loop.
A capsule endoscopy was performed which detected 10 minutes before the first image of the cecum an eroded submucosal appearance of 1 cm with bleeding on the sheet.
A surgical exploration was performed.
A lesion < 1 cm was identified on the surface of the intestine at 70 cm from the ileocecal valve, pink on the pale mucosa; without other lesions or adenopathies in the rest of the abdominal cavity, mesentery and
A 7 cm enterectomy was performed with safety margins of 3 cm and termino-terminal anastomosis.
The pathological study describes a proliferation of epithelioid eosinophilic cells of irregular size and prominent nucleoli, lobes and small vascular lumens containing vesicles.
Immunohistochemistry CD34+ with a proliferation index Ki67 of 20% shows intermediate malignancy, compatible with a hemangioendothelioma.
The PET-CT study did not detect pathological uptake.
The patient is in remission after three years of follow-up.
