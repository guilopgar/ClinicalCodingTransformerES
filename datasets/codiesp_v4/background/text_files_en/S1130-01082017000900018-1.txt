We report the case of a 61-year-old male, operated 30 days before for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, who presented anemizing rectal bleeding (hemoglobin: 6 g/dl), requiring transfusion of four intravenous iron concentrates.
Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound were requested.
colitis associated with severe colonic ischemia is diagnosed.
CMV serology reflects viral reactivation.
Quantitative analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected the presence of viral DNA in serum (1,670 copies/ml).
Absolute diet and treatment with intravenous ganvir 500 mg/12 hours were established, maintaining broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Twenty days after initiating antiviral treatment, symptoms persisted, hemoglobin levels remained stable (9.5 g/dl) and viral load was undetectable.
The patient was discharged with normal radiological control.
