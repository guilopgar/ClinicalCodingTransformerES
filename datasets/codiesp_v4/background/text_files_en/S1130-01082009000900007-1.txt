A 73-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hiatal hernia, colonic lithiasis, urinary tract infection and previous abdominal surgery (hysterectomy).
He came to the emergency room for diffuse abdominal pain with peritoneal irritation and vomiting for 24 hours.
Laboratory tests showed mild leukocytosis (11,600/mm3) and increased C-reactive protein (19 mg/dl).
Abdominal CT detected a foreign body in the small intestine, with pneumoperitoneum and free intra-abdominal fluid.
A midline laparotomy was performed, observing a bridle zone with an ileal loop that presented a perforation of about 2 mm, caused by a foreign body and diffuse purulent peritonitis.
We proceeded to the lysis of adhesions, the extraction of the object - ringworm - and simple suture of the perforation, with lavages of the abdominal cavity.
Antibiotic therapy was established with ephepenem (1 g/24 h/e.v.).
The patient, with a prostrate denture, reported the intake of a chicken flocks three weeks before.
She was discharged on the sixth day without complications.
