A 37-year-old patient presented with hypogastric pain, cyclic hematuria, and left renal fossa pain associated with menstruation.
Ultrasound showed a left footlocalised dilatation grade II-III/IV, probably related to an increased bladder lesion.
The CT confirmed the ectasia described above and the left renal functional delay, as well as an imprint and irregular and nodular thickening of the bladder base.
Cystoscopy revealed a congestive and edematous lesion in the left hemitrigone, which was biopsied and reported as glandular cyst.
The patient underwent surgery with the diagnosis of suspected locally advanced uterine tumor with ureter-vesical involvement.
Through a transperitoneal infraumbilical laparotomy, radical hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, partial cystectomy and left cystocystostomy were performed.
The definitive histological study reported bladder, ureteral and ovarian endometriosis.
