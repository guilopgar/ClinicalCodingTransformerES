We report the case of a 48-year-old woman who underwent gynecological surgery (hysterectomy plus double adnexectomy).
After this intervention, she presents a picture of right lumbar pain, which is why the urology service is required.
Intravenous urography showed normal left renal concentration and elimination, while the absence of elimination by the kidney was observed on the right side, as well as multiple surgical clips.
1.
When a ureteral affectation is suspected in the surgery, it is decided to place a right double J catheter, with ureteral obstruction having some difficulty.
During the intraoperative control, the correct placement of the catheter is visualized, and the patient's symptoms disappear.
1.
Ten days after this procedure the patient begins again with right lumbar pain and fever, a simple abdominal X-ray is performed in which a proximal migration of the double J catheter is confirmed.
1.
It was decided to replace the catheter by endoscopy, which was impossible to perform because it could not reach ureteral lumen proximal to the crossing with the iliac.
It was decided to place a percutaneous nephrostomy and remove it through the catheter.
1.
Once the initial condition of the patient was resolved, it was decided to place an antegrade ureteral catheter through nephrostomy, allowing its removal.
