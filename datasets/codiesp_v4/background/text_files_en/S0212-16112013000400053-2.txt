A 70-year-old male with previous total gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma treated with oral chemoradiation for post-surgical tumor without evidence of recurrence was admitted for left frontotemporoparietal subdural hematoma in the context of cranium anticoagulant trauma.
Hematoma evacuation was performed by craniotomy.
The neurological outcome was poor, affecting the patient in a state of vegetative coma.
A nasojejunal feeding tube (NYS) was introduced through a nasojejunal tube (NES) with frequent mechanical complications related to accidental exits and proposed placement of a stabilized feeding tube to the patient.
Three months after admission to our hospital, the patient was transferred to another hospital for a second medical opinion.
After a global reassessment of the patient and a new NE through SNYron and loop ileostomy, the patient was discharged to our unit for technical support and monitoring of the HEN.
