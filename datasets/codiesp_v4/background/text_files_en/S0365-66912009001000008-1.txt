A four-month-old girl referred by her dermatologist with a diagnosis of IP to rule out associated ocular pathology.
The skin showed typical lesions of this disease, the so-called Blaschko lines.
The ocular examination performed in the consultation showed good visual behavior in both eyes (AO), normal anterior segment, normal intrinsic ocular motility and normal.
The examination of the eye fundus (FO) with indirect ophthalmoscopy was normal in the right eye (OD) and in the left eye (LE) there was a slight bleeding in the nasal part.
Due to the difficulty in performing continuous movements of the patient, a new exploration of the FO was programmed under narcosis and fluorescein angiography when occult vascular lesions were suspected.
In this exploration a new exploration of the FO with indirect ophthalmoscopy and Retcam II (Massie Lab.) was carried out, which allows to archive the images in digital format, for further detailed analysis.
In the RE, a hypopigmented paramacular lesion and a slight alteration in the course of a vessel in extreme temporal periphery were observed.
In the OI, there was a linear hemorrhage in the nasal periphery, with no evidence of other findings.
Fluorescent angiography was performed, injecting 5 ml of sodium fluorescein per kilogram of weight intravenously, which in our case were 0.35 ml.
Serial photographs were taken with Retcam II that showed lesions not observed in previous endoscopy.
In the RE, punctiform exudation was observed in extreme temporal periphery.
OI showed no perfusion of the entire nasal periphery.
Diode laser was used to treat the entire affected nasal area of the left eye (1,200 impacts, 300 mW, 300 ms).
