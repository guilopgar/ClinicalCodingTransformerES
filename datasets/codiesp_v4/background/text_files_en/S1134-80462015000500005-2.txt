A 56-year-old man presented with paresthesia (no pain) in the back (high dorsal region on the left side) for about two years, together with greater sensitivity to the rubbing of the clothes.
The examination revealed an area of hyperesthesia in the left scapular region, with cutaneous and dynamic hyperesthesia, a delimited circular area that did not correspond to the area of hyperpigmentation.
The cervical and dorsal spine MRI showed disc protrusions in the C4, C5, C6 and D1 zones, without radicular involvement, without spinal cord involvement and with normal neurophysiological study.
It was decided not to start treatment, since the patient was not bothered by these symptoms and was not a source of it either.
