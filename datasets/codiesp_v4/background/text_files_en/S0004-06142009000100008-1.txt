We report the case of a 51-year-old woman who after being diagnosed with bladder augmentation tumor in June 2006, underwent radical cystectomy with bilateral ilioobturator-obturator lymphadenectomy, hysterectomy.
Most of the vagina was removed, leaving the external third that was sutured using simple vicryl stitches of 3/0.
Anatomopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of high grade colloid mucinous adenocarcinoma, pT2N0M0.
The patient had an uneventful postoperative period, with removal of ureteral catheters at 7 days and cystostomy tube at 9 days.
Before the removal of the urethral catheter, a cystography was performed, which reported a periprosthetic leak that was resolved by applying traction, without observing leakage of urine.
The urethral catheter was finally removed at 28 days.
In subsequent controls the patient reported urine leakage, without being able to specify whether these were vaginal or urethral.
Physical examination showed a correct suture at the level of the vagina without visible lesions, but urine leakage through the vagina.

A cystoscopy was finally performed, which showed a fistulous orifice of 8 mm at the level of the urethro-ileal anastomosis, corresponding to the voiding cystourethrography point, with voiding cyst.
