A 34-year-old man presented with an optometrist consultation to assess an iridian tumour with no functional repercussions.
The physical examination shows an elevated formation of cystic appearance and content at iris level, near the pupillary rim.
No antecedent of interest was mentioned.
BMU and OCT images were obtained and the diagnosis of primary stromal cyst of iris was established.
In all the above mentioned cases, the mean examination time using both instruments varied considerably, thus, OCT performed complete explorations of the anterior segment in less than 5 minutes.
On the other hand, the BMU, mainly due to its previous preparation, as well as the greater difficulty in locating the lesions to study, involved exploration times greater than 10 minutes.
