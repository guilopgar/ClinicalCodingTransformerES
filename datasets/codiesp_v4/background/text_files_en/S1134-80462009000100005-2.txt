A 55-year-old male patient diagnosed with primary osteoarthrosis, very disabling, with right hip prosthesis in treatment with Durogesic® 25 μg/h.
It is treated in the same way for 8 years.
Currently the patient continues with Durogesic® 50 μg/h.
One year ago she presented a psychotic bud, which is why she had to be admitted psychiatrically.
Upon discharge from the hospital, fentanyl 50 μg/h (generic) was prescribed.
As a result of this change, pain becomes more severe and a withdrawal syndrome characterised by restlessness, irritability and a confusional state that disappeared when Durog® was restarted.
