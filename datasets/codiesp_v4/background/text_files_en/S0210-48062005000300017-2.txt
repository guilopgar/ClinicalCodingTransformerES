A 17-year-old male with no relevant past medical history.
She came to the emergency room due to fever, hypogastric pain and a irritating voiding syndrome.
Blood analysis showed leukocytosis with deviation to the left and urinary piuria and bacteriuria.
Abdominal ultrasound showed a cystic hypogastric mass with inside contents that seemed to connect with the bladder dome.
A CT scan of the urachus,homogeneous and containing a supravesical mass, was performed in order to better assess the case.
With the diagnosis of infected urachal cyst, surgical intervention is programmed, performing an infraumbilical midline laparotomy allowing complete excision of the urachal remnants.
