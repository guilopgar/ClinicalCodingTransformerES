A 61-year-old male presented emesis after some episodes of arcades.
He had liver cirrhosis but no previous bleeding.
An upper endoscopy revealed a wide tear of 10 cm affecting the mucosa and submucosa of the distal esophagus, respecting a 2 cm long segment proximal to the Z line. Laceration showed that a slow injection of 1:1 polyp caused a rebleed bleeding.
The recurrence of bleeding 8 days later was controlled with the application of another 4 endoclips.
There was no other hemorrhagic recurrence and endoscopy was repeated at week 6 and week 24, with no residual lesion.
