A 53-year-old female patient, previously healthy, with a three-week history of general malaise, fatigue, weight loss, headache and generalized myalgia.
The next week, the patient developed painful erythematous plaques and papules, predominantly on her face, neck, arms and faces.
Laboratory tests showed neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia and blasts.
The diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was confirmed by bone marrow study, so it was decided to start induction chemotherapy with fever associated rubicin and cytarabine and adjuvant therapy with FilgrastimÂ® (G-CSF)
At 13 days post-chemotherapy, together with an increase in the number of neutrophils, the patient presented an increase in lesions, in the form of blisters and hemorrhagic bullae surrounded by inflammatory plaques highly sensitive neck, arthralgia.
The presence of viral, fungal, and bacterial infections was ruled out by examinations and cultures of the pseudo-pole fluid.
The patient persisted with fever, headache and erosions with conjunctivitis and oral mucosa and tongue associated with gingival hyperplasia.
A biopsy of the skin lesions showed edema and dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis, with no signs of vasculitis, compatible with Sweet's syndrome.
As a result of the above, intravenous hydroquinone treatment was started, which was associated with a significant improvement in skin lesions.
However, the patient died before starting the second cycle of chemotherapy due to heart and respiratory failure.
No autopsy was obtained.
