A 60-year-old male with no relevant personal history presented with epigastric discomfort, jaundice, choluria and a few days of evolution.
Physical examination revealed only jaundice.
Analytical analysis showed AST 57 U/l, ALT 172 U/l, GGT 564 U/l, FA 272 U/l, total bilirubin 8.15 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 5.72 mg/dl. Serology
CT showed a large cystic mass of 20 × 10 × 12 cm in the left liver lobe, with vesicles in its interior, compressing the inferior vena cava and through the hiatus extending the descending aorta, displacing the esophagus.
She was treated with albendazole for four weeks and subsequently underwent surgery.
Through midline laparotomy, the cyst was punctured-aspirated, sterilized with hypertonic saline solution and partial cystopericystectomy with drainage of the residual cavity.
The biopsy confirmed the hydatid nature of the cyst.
There were no postoperative complications and it was high on the 7th postoperative day, maintaining the treatment with albendazol.
