This is a 45-year-old male who suffered a coche accident.
The initial assessment was hemodynamically stable.
On admission, a CT-scan showed a pseudoaneurysm of the thoracic aorta distal to the left subclavian artery with periaortic bleeding.
He was admitted to the ICU where medical treatment was initiated.
36 hours later, a surgical repair was performed with endoprosthesis in the descending thoracic aorta through the left femoral approach.
There was an asymptomatic occlusion of the left subclavian artery.
A follow-up CT scan at 6 days showed a correct location of the stent.
On the tenth day she had acute pericarditis and was discharged on the sixteenth day, asymptomatic.
