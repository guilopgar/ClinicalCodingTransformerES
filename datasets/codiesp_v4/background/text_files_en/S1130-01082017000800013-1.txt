We report the case of a 70-year-old man, with no history of interest, who came to the emergency department for a five-week history of watery diarrhea with mucus, with more than six daily stools.
On arrival, the patient presented signs of severe voiding and hydroelectrolytic alterations, although he remained hemodynamically stable and without alterations in the level of consciousness.
On admission, the following analytical parameters stand out: urea 228 mg/dl, creatinine 1.8 mg/dl, sodium 120 mEq/l, potassium 2.5 mEq/l and chlorine 83 mEq/l.
After volume replacement and electrolytes, a rectal polyp is detected which occupies more than 50% of the circumference of the rectum and extends from the least compatible 10 cm line.
Since the tumor is not approached endoscopically, the patient undergoes amputation due to non-perineal stenosis terminal.
