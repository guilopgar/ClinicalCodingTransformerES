A 47-year-old patient presented to the emergency department with persistent umbilical suppuration and pain, without fever or other symptoms.
The patient had been on antibiotics (cloxacillin) and healed in his health center without any improvement.
Umbilical secretion cultures were negative.
The examination revealed an umbilical suppuration and a mean infraumbilical-line swelling of approximately 4 cm, with associated colitis.
The abdomen was blade and depressible, without peritonitis.
Blood tests were normal (no leukocytosis).
An ultrasound showed an infraumbilical collection located in the muscular plane between the two abdominal rectuses, of approximately 27 x 16 x 30 mm, of heterogeneous echogenicity, which communicated superficially.
The study was completed with a CAT scan, which showed infraumbilical inflammatory changes and a collection of about 3 cm, with a granulomatous component, corresponding to a sinus of the omphalitis associated with changes.
The urachal ligament that connects with the bladder, obliterated, was objectified distal to it.

The surgery consisted of en bloc resection of uracosinus with omphalectomy.
The postoperative course was uneventful.
Pathology ruled out malignancy.
There were no recurrence data after 18 months of follow-up.
