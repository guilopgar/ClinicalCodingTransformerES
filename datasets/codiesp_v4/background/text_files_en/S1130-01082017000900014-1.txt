We report the case of a 30-year-old man with a history of HIV infection, diagnosed with a pathological mucosal defect with purulent exudate in the rectosigmoid.
Malignant process was ruled out and microbiological analysis of stools was positive for herpes simplex virus type 2 and Chalmydia trachomatis.
He was treated with valganvir and tape, but with progressive constipation.
A new rectoscopy showed a fibrotic and ulcerated area in the distal rectum, with negative biopsies and microbiological analysis.
Because of the persistence of the clinic with conservative treatment, it was decided to perform anterior resection of the ultralow rectum with coloanal reservoir and ileostomy.
After a complicated postoperative period, traffic is repeated without incidents, with current monitoring without complications.
Immunohistochemical study was negative.
