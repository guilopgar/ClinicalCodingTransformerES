A 1-year and 9-month-old male patient attended the Plastic Surgery Department as an outpatient for limb malformations since birth.
The mother reported that she used oral contraceptives at the beginning of pregnancy, up to the 5th month of pregnancy and had late prenatal consultation.
At 7 months, by ultrasound examination, a diagnosis of fetal right forearm was made.
After birth by vaginal delivery, a series of malformations were identified that included constriction bands in the middle third of the right forearm and in the third finger of the left hand, syndactyly and amngylitis.

Surgical treatment was indicated after routine preoperative tests and with the consent of the Pediatric and Anesthesiology Departments.
The surgical plan included resection of the bands and the performance of zetaplasty for release of fibrotic stents.
The patient underwent general anesthesia and all aseptic and antisepsis rules were respected.
We performed rectangular flaps associated with zetaplasties for the release of the third finger of the left hand and the constriction band of the right forearm; then we released the 1st and 5th digits of the right hand
Sutures were performed with polyamide 4/00.
The postoperative course was satisfactory with good aesthetic and functional results.
