We report the case of a 44-year-old woman with clinical symptoms of intestinal occlusion.
In the enteroresonance is observed an image of approximately 14 cm in length with target morphology in its section, with a nodular lesion in its extreme, of probable submucosal location.
Surgical resection of the lesion was performed.
Twenty-five months later the patient remains without recurrence.
Pathological analysis showed a 2.5 cm submucosal polypoid tumor that ulcerated the mucosa.
It was formed by nests of epithelioid cells with some dispersed cells of ganglion type.
Immunohistochemical study showed positivity for S-100 in most cells, and positivity for enolase and synaptophysin in ganglion-type cells.
Proliferation rate was less than 10%.
