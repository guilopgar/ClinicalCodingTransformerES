We report the case of a 40-year-old man with abdominal pain and diaphoresis after ingestion of 30 g of hach√≠s for illegal transportation, so he was guarded by the National Police throughout his stay in the hospital.
Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed two 4 cm and 3 cm foreign bodies in the ileum, with signs of mechanical obstruction without perforation, which were spontaneously detected 24 hours later.
At the 48-hour follow-up CT, another foreign body was described in the gastric antrum, not previously objectified. An oral endoscopy was performed with a Dormia basket, with a 4-cm retracted morphology.
The procedure was performed without complications under deep sedation by an anesthesiologist.
