A 35-year-old pregnant woman 3 and two previous cesarean sections was referred to our service for evaluation due to a large abdominal tumor at 36 weeks of gestation.
The patient had a history of some other comorbidity, mentioning that he had noticed tumor growth for two years, but had not sought medical attention.
Physical examination revealed cachexia with an evident abdominal tumor extending from the right subcostal angle and part of the left to the pubic symphysis, displacing the midline of the uterus.
An ultrasound reported that the fetus had a biophysical profile 8/8 and structurally without compromising data.
During the exploration, the patient was found to have labor against childbirth for which magnetic resonance could not be performed and the patient was sent to the labor room where cervical dilation was found and was in active phase.
Due to the history of two previous cesarean sections, a cesarean section was performed, finding a neonate weighing 3,200 g, reactive and without apparent cachexia data.
During cesarean section, oncological support was requested, and transoperative biopsies were performed, with the results being uneventful when comparing an oncological versus liposarcoma.
Due to the nutritional status of the patient it was decided to close the incision and postpone the resection of the tumor until a final report of pathology, which was positive for a well-differentiated retroperitoneal liposarcoma.
The tumor respected adjacent organs (stump, ureters and great vessels) and was resected without apparent complications.
The specimen under inspection was 52 x 40 x 35 cm, weighing 12,500 grams.
The final report agreed with previous biopsies, with no data of metastasis to adjacent organs.
