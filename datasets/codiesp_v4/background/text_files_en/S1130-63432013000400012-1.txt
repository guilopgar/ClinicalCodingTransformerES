We report the case of development of type 1 DM probably associated with treatment with isotretinoin.
A 17-year-old male weighing 62 kg who began treatment with isotretinoin at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg every 24 hours, indicated by his dermatologists for presenting grade II acne resistant to other drugs.
All biochemical parameters were normal in the laboratory prior to initiation of therapy except a slight elevation of fasting blood glucose (131 mg/dL; reference values (VR) = 74-106 mg/dL), which was repeated at baseline (4.586 mg/dL).
In a review performed six months after the start of therapy, a fasting blood glucose of 299 mg/dL and HbA1c of 11.9% were detected, with an increase in total cholesterol levels (302 mg/dL) decided to discontinue treatment.
The patient was then diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycaemic crisis and started treatment with insulin.
In the subsequent follow-up, the lipid profile was normalized two months after the drug, maintaining high glycemia, as well as HbA1c (discontinuation).
During the diagnostic process, antibodies to carboxoxyamate 65 (GADA), islets (anti-islots), insulin (IA) and anti-IAA non-autoimmune tyrosine kinase (anti-cell) are requested.
The patient also had no family history of DM.
Ten months after drug withdrawal, the patient continues to require insulin therapy, achieving adequate metabolic control (HbA1C = 5.8%).
