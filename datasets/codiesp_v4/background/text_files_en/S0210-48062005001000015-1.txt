Patient who comes for the first time to the Urology consultation for an episode of right nephritic colic at 55 years.
The patient's personal history included type II diabetes controlled with diet, pneumonia at 30 years of age, and cystectomy at 18 years of age.
The patient has a history of deaf discomfort in the right renal fossa, continuous, about 20 years of evolution.
Among the diagnostic tests there is an urological ultrasound that is reported as low arrangement of the kidneys in the right iliac fossa, appearing compatible findings with crossed renal fusion with fusion.
Having crossed these findings proceeds to the realization of a UIV, which identifies both kidneys in the right lumbar fossa, with marked rotation of its axes and complete integrity of the collecting systems, with a "feeling" of normal bladder
1.
Three years later, the patient was referred for digestive consultation due to discomfort.
A CT scan performed by this service showed a 4.5 cm mass in the lower pole of the ectopic kidney, without lymphadenopathy.
It was decided to perform a tumorectomy after performing selective arteriography to study the disposition of the renal vessels.
During surgery, renal vessels and ureters of both kidneys were identified.
Neoformation located on the lower pole of the ectopic kidney is observed, leading to tumorectomy of the mass.
1.
The macroscopic study of the specimen shows a tumor of 4.5 x 3.5 x 2 cm ovoid form and soft consistency.
Cutting is whitish with blistery zones and presents a surrounding capsule.
The microscopic study labels the mass as a non-special non-papillary renal cell carcinoma type (clear cells) Fuhrman grade 2 4.5 cm in diameter that respects the surgical edge.
Intraoperative biopsy of the tumor bed showed no evidence of malignancy.
Currently the patient is asymptomatic and free of tumor recurrence or metastasis after 6 years of follow-up by serial CT.
