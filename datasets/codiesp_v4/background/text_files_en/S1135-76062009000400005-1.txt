In October 2007 there was a massive escape of inmates imprisoned in a prison in the province of Panama.
During the search procedure, it was possible to recapture one of the escaped persons who was questioned by police officers in an area of the prison, according to witness versions.
Later, this arrested man died on the way to the hospital where he was being sent due to the suffered blows "on falling from a tree" during his recapture, according to the first declarations of the National Police.
At autopsy multiple recent traumatic lesions were observed and documented, distributed throughout the body of the deceased, who was wives at the level of both wrists, toward the anterior part of his body.

When the wives were removed, multiple blunt lesions were observed in the anterior chest and upper abdomen.
The same lesions were observed on the back.
Of these, correspond to standard lesions compatible with an enlarged cydrical object ("police bar").

The autopsy technique used was "peel off", in which the skin and soft tissues of the trunk and extremities are dissected by planes, for the detection of deep lesions that are not visible [3].

The most evident external injuries were located in the trunk and lower limbs, while the most serious internal injuries were located in the skull.
The cause of death was acute subdural hematoma secondary to cranioencephalic trauma.
