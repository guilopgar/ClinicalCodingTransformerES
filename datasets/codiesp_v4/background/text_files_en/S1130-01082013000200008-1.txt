A 29-year-old man presented with abdominal pain in the upper abdomen and vomiting.
The patient had a history of abdominal pain and chronic vomiting.
Abdominal CT showed an anomalous arrangement of the intestinal loops located in the upper hemiabdomen.
He also had horseshoe kidney, and the diagnosis was intestinal occlusion with volvulus intestinal malrotation.
Laparotomy was performed, showing the small intestine displaced and volvulus contained by Ladd's fibrotic bands in a transmesocolic hernia, and a Ladd procedure was performed (analysis of viable intestinal openings and resection).
After the intervention the evolution of the patient was favorable without incidents.
