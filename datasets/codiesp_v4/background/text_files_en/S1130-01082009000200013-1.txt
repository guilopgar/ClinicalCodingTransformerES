We report the case of a 67-year-old female patient with no toxic habits and personal history of hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and autoimmune atrophic gastritis (with positive cholecystectomies August 1/160, 2007.
In January 2008, an abdominal CAT was performed due to epi discomfort irradiated in a belt as well as loss of weight, objectifying a thickened epigastric examination and a complete gastrointestinal examination for which gastric walls were identified.
Analytical analysis showed only a pattern of stasis with the rest of parameters and tumor markers within normal limits.
Gastroscopy showed a 5 mm sessile polyp in the fundus on an atrophic mucosa, which was removed and whose pathological study resulted in diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma.
No locoregional lymphadenopathy was observed on upper endoscopy.
Given the pathological anatomy findings, it was programmed for total gastrectomy, during which macroscopically there was no apparent macroscopic gastric tumor, no lymph node or peritoneal involvement.
Histopathology of the surgical specimen showed multiple differentiated neuroendocrine tumors type I (non-surgical fundus tumors) with margins in the body and fundus of 1-5 mm, associated with hyperplasia of chronic gastritis neuroendocrine cells of the body or foci
The patient was admitted favorably after the intervention.
