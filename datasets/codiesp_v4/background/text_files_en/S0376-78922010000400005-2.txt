A 78-year-old male patient presented with deep burns in approximately 40% of the total body surface, affecting both lower limbs.
After debridement and grafting of the affected areas, she presents chronic ulceration with tibial exposure and right external malleolus.
Due to the impossibility of performing local or free flaps for defect reconstruction, we opted for treatment with vacuum therapy RenasysÂ® to-125 mm Hg, after performing perforations on the exposed tibial surface.
Because of this, granulation tissue appears on the area that allowed subsequent coverage.
Partial skin grafts were implanted without incidents, achieving total healing in 10 days.
