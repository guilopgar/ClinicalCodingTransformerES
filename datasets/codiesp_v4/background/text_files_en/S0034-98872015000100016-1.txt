A 41-year-old male patient with no known morbid history and no pharmacological prescription.
It has a body mass index (BMI) of 43.5 (159.5 kilos of weight; 1.91 meters of height), with a daily intake of approximately 4,500 calories.
At the same time from 25 years of age, she started occasional consumption of snorted cocaine at a frequency of approximately 1 g/week, in the context of nocturnal social events.
In 2010, he was submitted to evaluation for bariatric surgery, in which he omitted a history of drug use.
The surgical procedure performed was a gastric tube without postoperative complications, reaching a BMI of 26 kilos of weight.
Postoperative psychological support was not indicated.
Five months after the surgical intervention, the patient reported less tolerance to alcohol, intoxication, and a lesser degree of consciousness, which was accompanied by a paulatine increase in the consumption of cocaine with premedication.
Before surgery, she only consumed cocaine in social settings; however, she consumed a total of 10 g of cocaine per week and up to 48 weekly units of standard drink (U.B.E) alone.
The increase in consumption is explained by the patient as “not being able to eat, consumed, changed food by cocaine”.
This change in the pattern of consumption correlates with the occurrence of significant anxiety, particularly associated with consequences of addictive behavior such as partner conflicts and loss of work, and also with the manifestation of paranoid ideation.
These symptoms motivated in 2012, consultation with the mental health team and it was decided to hospitalize them psychiatrically.
The patient was diagnosed with an interpersonal disorder motivation towards stability, alcohol and cocaine. The detoxification and rehabilitation process began, progressing with a favorable evolution, completing the 10-month treatment period with a healthy, long-term abstinence confirmed
