A 71-year-old man came to our service with a better corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/200 in his right eye and the absence of a macula with a cystic macular edema (CME) associated with vitreous coherence tomography.
The patient had a history of progressive loss of visual acuity in the right eye since cataract surgery with placement of intraocular lens placement and implantation of intraocular lens in the sac without complications in both eyes for 4 years without complications with soft tissue.
After ruling out other causes of uveitis, the diagnosis of PSM was established, and the patient underwent two injections of trisomy with a second injection of acetone (4.0 mg) 24/16 months after MAC, respectively.
Apart from the changes described in OCT and angiography, the rest of the exploration was normal, as well as the etiologic studies for uveitis negative.
1.
One week after intravitreal injection of benzaizumab (1μ,25 mg), the MAVC improved to 20/60 and OCT showed a decrease in macular thickness with reduction of intraretinal edema and 677 μ06 initial extension.
1.
Eight weeks later, she had a MACV of 20/40 and a marked thinning was demonstrated by OCT (677μ initial to 356μ).
1.
At the end of the follow-up period (three months after injection), the authors observed no ocular complications and a BCVA of 20/40 with a significant reduction in thickness (from 677μ at baseline to 267μ).
