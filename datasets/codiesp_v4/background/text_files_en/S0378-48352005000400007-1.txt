He had a prosthesis on his left knee.
She presented with abdominal pain in the left iliac fossa of 1 week of evolution and progressive intensity.
Investigations:
· Opaque enema: arthritis in descending colon.
• CEA: 2.4; CA19.9: 1.2
 TAC and Abdominal ultrasound : Ascites loculated in mesogastrium, right vacuum and perihepatic region.
Peritoneal nodules compatible with appendix mucocele peritoneal carcinomatosis.

With the radiological diagnosis of peritoneal pseudomyxoma, he was operated on 26-11-1998.
Intraoperatively, mucoid ascites with several implants in the greater omentum, posterior gastric side, others in right and left parietal peritoneum and vesicoperitoneal reflection are described.
Tumor in externalized vermicular appendix 10 x 6 x 3 cm. Exeresis of all peritoneal implants and right colectomy are performed.

One month after the intervention, intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPQ) of CDDP was initiated at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in 100 cc of saline solution in 4 hours, with prior regular intravenous prehydration at 5 days.
He received 6 cycles of this scheme.
The dose was reduced to 75 % for grade 1 renal failure.
In addition, she had anemia 2o and neutropenia 3o according to WHO criteria, so the fifth cycle of chemotherapy was postponed one week.
Non-pelvic TAC after the third cycle was normal.
Subsequently, he has followed controls in our service by abdominal-thoracic TAC studies and CEA and CA19.9 with no signs of progression, with a follow-up of 65 months.
