A 74-year-old man, resident in Puerto Vallarta, was attacked by a river crocodile at 8:20 a.m. on June 5, 2010 on the coast of Boca Negra fishing.
The victim reports that she observed the crocodile "to jump" out of the water and, although she tried to avoid it, she was attacked on the left arm.
Then the reptile floated it to the water, and it sank.
Although the man was able to release himself, he suffered amputation due to tearing of the left forearm from the brachyar muscle to the radial head of the triceps and lateral head of the triceps brachii muscle, with exposure of the tape.
The person was sent to the hospital where the lesions were located.
It should be noted that the victim manifests having hit the eyes of the crocodile to achieve its release.
