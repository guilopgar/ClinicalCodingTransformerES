A 34-year-old patient, born in Zacatecas and residing in Tijuana B.C., was a policeman, with no relevant history.
Eight months after the sting of a spider, he presented disseminated lesions in the head, neck, anterior trunk, posterior and abdomen.
Poorly defined plaques, confluent, were observed, some with meliceric crusts and other blood vessels, on an erythematous base.
The abdomen had a zosteriform appearance.
Histology and culture were positive for Coccidioides spp.
A systemic disease was ruled out and she was treated with itraconazole 300 mg daily for six months with resolution of the condition.
