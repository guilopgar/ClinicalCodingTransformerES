The patient was discharged home after 36 days of life, with no personal history of interest, and was brought to the emergency room by her parents because she "has a pen in her head".
Parents say that when they cut their hair a couple of days ago they have noticed a small white feather on their head.
You don't know if you have it from birth or if it's gone after.
They say he's losing a lot of hair, but the pen won't fall off.
Physical examination is normal except for a feather of approximately 3-4 mm in length in the right occipitotemporal region.
There is no local inflammation, edema or erythema in the area.

After cleaning and disinfection using tweezers, the entire pen is removed without incidents.
A 7 mm pen is seen, ending in a sharp and sharp end, which penetrated about 2-3 mm on the skin of a child.
The evolution is good: local cures are recommended at home with topical desinfecation and the wound heals without complications.
1.
Parents are asked about the possible origin of the pen (coaches or pillows).
Loosen the baby's bed linen is not feathery, but rather edredon from the parents' bed, where the baby sleeps a few nights and where the mother breastfeeds it at night.
After going home, the parents provide several fragments of feathers that easily leave the edredon of their bed and are similar to those extracted from the child's head.
