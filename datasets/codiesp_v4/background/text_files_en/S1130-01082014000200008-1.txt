We present the clinical case of a 68-year-old patient with multiple vascular risk factors (hypertensive, diabetic, ex-smoker, dyslipidemic and hyperuricemic) associated with chronic kidney disease secondary to hypertension treatment.
He was treated with cinacalcet, resincalcium, and calcium acetate with lanthanum carbonate.
Other notable vascular events are chronic ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke.
On the day of admission she presented with acute and intense pain in the mesogastrium, non-irradiated and accompanied by two vomiting and several liquid stools without pathological products; she did not have fever or other associated symptoms.
Physical examination was anodyne.
Blood tests were performed in the emergency room, highlighting: blood glucose 209 mg/dl, urea 73 mg/dl, creatinine.
Normal CRP, abdominal x-ray, Hb 15.8 g/dl, HTO 51, leukocytes 22.34 (86 % NT), PQ 171, procalcitonin (PCT) 1,55 ng/ml reactive protein
She was diagnosed with ischemic colitis.
An absolute diet and symptomatic treatment without antibiotic therapy were established, with complete disappearance of symptoms within 48 hours.
Complete analytical normalization was confirmed, including biochemistry, liver profile, PCT (0.74 ng/ml) and complete blood count - leukocytes 9.70 (normal formula), so we did not consider the need for additional tests.
A control X-ray was performed before discharge after the process was resolved.
Multiple radio-opaque images are observed throughout the colon trajectory with a contrast-like appearance and in relation to the lanthanum carbonate collection.
Treatment was continued because it was not directly related to the current clinical picture.
It is suspected that the clinical picture that motivates admission is acute enterocolitis of infectious origin, possibly viral, with a favorable evolution.
