A 24-year-old male with a rural residence in the IX region, with no known morbid history.
He was admitted to the emergency service after suffering a low-energy traffic accident without presenting lesions of consideration secondary to it.
After one week, the patient consulted due to progressive weakness of the lower limbs, dorsalgia of moderate intensity, and difficulty sleeping.
Examination revealed bilateral hypoesthesia from D5 to distal level, moderate paraparesis, bilateral patellar and achilles osteotendinous hyperrephexia with a bilateral positive Babinski sign. A spinal cord trauma was hospitalized.
The imaging study with radiograph (Rx) of the dorsal spine showed D3 body crushing.
Computed axial tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the dorsal spine showed multiple cysts of variable size in the right invasive zone with spinal cord involvement and posterior elements of D2, D3 and D4 etiology
A directed anamnesis was carried out where the patient pointed to dorsalgia of three years of evolution with an episode of strength decrease in lower extremities that reverted spontaneously.
Laboratory tests showed no abnormalities.
1.
Treatment with albendazole was initiated and a D3-D4 hemilaminectomy was performed with cyst excision, confirming the histopathological study the diagnosis of bone hydatid disease.
The patient recovered complete mobility of the lower limbs without sphincter deficit.
The study with chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound showed no disseminated hydatid disease.
It comprises four cycles of albendazole.
After three months she was again operated on for hydatid dorsal abscess and 5 years later for a new episode of progressive paraparesis with sensory level in D5 performing laminectomy D3-D4 cyst with excision
