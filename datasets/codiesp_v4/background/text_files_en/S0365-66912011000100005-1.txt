A 23-year-old woman presented with sudden decrease in visual acuity (VA) in BE.
In its history alone highlights the presence of myopia of -0.75 in OA.
The patient reported having initiated the previous day a treatment prescribed by her neurologist with coughmaxÂ® 25mg administered orally (Topa, Janssen-Cilag) every 12 hours as prophylaxis for migraine.
The initial examination showed a VA with its correction (AV CC) of 0.2 in BE that improved to 0.4 with stenopeic.
Pupillary motility was normal, intraocular pressure (IOP) 18 mm Hg in BE and showed no abnormalities in anterior biomicroscopy (ABM).
Cycloplegic refraction (RBC) was -4.50 in OA.
In the eye fundus (FO) were observed striae tendineae in the AO macula.
Computed tomography (CT) revealed no abnormalities in the orbital region or abnormalities in the position of the iridocristalinic diaphragm.
The patient was treated conservatively and then examined 24 hours later.
BCVA was 0.6 in BE and -1.75 in OA.
No striae were observed in the FO and no alterations were observed in the fluorescein angiography.
The campimetry showed a more marked arciform defect in the left eye.
A week later, the VACC was unit, the WBR was -0.75 and visual field defects had occurred.
