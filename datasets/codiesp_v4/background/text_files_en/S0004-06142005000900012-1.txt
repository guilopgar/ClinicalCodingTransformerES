A 20-year-old male diagnosed with rhabosarcoma at 2 years of age, who underwent surgical treatment with chemotherapy and subsequent radiotherapy. He was free of retroperitoneal disease four years earlier due to later controls.
She came to the emergency room of the hospital with urinary retention with leaks due to anger and constitutional syndrome with malaise and pain.
On physical examination, there is muscle weakness, occupation and pain associated with hypogastric tenderness, in which a mass is identified as bladder globe.
The imaging study (CAT and MRI) showed bilateral granule hydronephrosis and a well-defined mass with a well-defined appearance, which appeared to be encapsulated in front of the prostate, which seemed to be microbladder.
No lymphadenopathy was observed.
1.
Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate puncture-biopsy was performed under general anesthesia, and with the diagnosis of myxoid sarcoma radical cystoprostatectomy was performed with derivation of both ureters in gunshot.
In the extension study no metastases were observed and no further adjuvant treatment was performed.
In the macroscopic study of the specimen, a tumor of 8 cm maximum is observed occupying the prostate and encompassing the seminal vesicle, not recognizing pro-preserved diameter parenchyma.
The microscopic study showed a tumor composed of spindle cells, with mild cytological atypia and frequent mitotic figures, arranged with a lax pattern, with areas of higher cell density.
Enmerged in the tumor, elongated glandular structures are seen, corresponding to non-contrast prostatic glandular structures.
Immunohistochemical study was performed to determine CD34, Vimentin, broad-spectrum cytokeratin, Actin smooth muscle specific, Desmin, protein S-100, CD11ak progesterone isolated expression Cytom California, estrogen receptors
