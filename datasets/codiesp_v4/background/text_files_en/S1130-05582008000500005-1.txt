We present a clinical case of a third molar fused to a fourth supernumerary molar in a 36-year-old male patient who comes to the Department of Medicine and Oral Surgery for presenting episodes of pain, inflammation and a third molar.
The exploration revealed a large third molar in semi-erupted mesioangular position, responsible for the episodes of pericoronaritis.
We performed an orthopantomography in which we observed the third molar attached to a supernumerary tooth by the crown and root.
There is the circumstance that the patient has another supernumerary molar in the maxilla right side.
1.
After making the clinical history of the patient (without any background of interest), the purpose and risks of the intervention are explained to the patient and signed the informed consent.
The patient rejects the possibility of performing a scanner to know the relationship of the molar with the canal of the inferior dental nerve.
Surgical extraction of the third and fourth molar was performed under local anesthesia, requiring odontosection due to the large size of the fused molar.
1.
There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications.
The patient comes for review at three months, discarding periodontal problems and presence of caries in the second molar.
