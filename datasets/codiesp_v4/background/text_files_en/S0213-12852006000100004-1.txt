We report the case of a 57-year-old male patient referred to the Department of Oral Medicine for presenting a tumor in the right cheek.
The patient was diagnosed with the tumor the previous year.
Since then growth was slow but constant.
She had a history of ex-smoker (20 cigarettes/day for 30 years) and was negative for alcohol abuse.
The medical history reported hypertension for 10 years, no previous neck or head surgery or radiant treatment.
Clinical examination revealed a hard tumor of 4 cm in diameter in the retrocommissural mucosa of the right cheek.
1.
The macroscopic appearance was a pedunculated neoformation covered by a layer of vascularized epithelium.
The surface was not homogeneous, with areas of ulceration intercalated with areas of hyperkeratosis, probably related to masticatory trauma.
The patient could ever have had the neoplasm outside the oral cavity.
1.
Surgical treatment consisted of excision of the mass after an incision to the base of the cyst, which appeared fibrous and scarce in vessels.
Closure was performed by first intention without difficulties in order to ensure a postoperative period without complications for the patient.
The specimen was dried, fixed in buffer solution at 10% formalin and prepared for microscopic examination.
1.
Histological data revealed a normal epithelium, with rare areas of hyperkeratinization, which recombined mature adipose tissue intercalated by wide bands and dense connective fascicles.
The external borders were delimited by the presence of a fibrous capsule.
The pathologist diagnosed fibrolipoma.
Three years after surgery there was no sign of recurrence.
