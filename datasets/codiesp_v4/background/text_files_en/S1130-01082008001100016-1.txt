A 61-year-old woman, widow, born in Alicante, mastectomized at 29 years of age due to breast carcinoma and treated with oophorectomy, receiving blood transfusion, showed a discrete positive clinical picture for HCV (1998)
In 2000 a liver biopsy was performed, finding a complete septal cirrhosis.

In a General Council on Cancer Unit, it is necessary to treat it as an inherited neoplasm (mutation of the BRCA-10 gene); his mother died (at 38 years old) of matrix neoplasia and one of his two sisters suffer from breast cancer.
It is treated with recombinant Î±-2 interferon, with incomplete response and limited tolerance to thrombocytopenia.
Elevated encephalopathy develops into cirrhosis, stage B-C, with mild encephalopathy (grade I), with moderate ascites (descitis Child), which has been completely diagnosed with colitis.
With Child-Pugh score 7 and MELD score 9.5, it is assessed in La Fe Hospital, and accepted at pre-transplant level for follow-up.
Although it was orophorectomized 30 years ago, given the strong indicator of bladder stress, it was also given in April 2006, since there were no more frequent abdominal discomforts (more than 155 other abdominal CT scans) but could be added as normal.

Due to the above and the acceptable evolution of the patient, we conclude that the increase of CA 12.5 was due to a peritoneal origin, because it is a glycoprotein associated with the colonic epithelium (4), although its most valuable carcinoma is pleurinous endometriosis.
