A 47-year-old woman with no relevant past medical history presented with rectal bleeding at the end of the deposition. She denied other accompanying symptoms, no abdominal pain or changes in bowel habits, no weight loss.
Physical examination is normal except for the presence of hemorrhoids in the rectal examination.
Analytical tests showed normal asymmetry and biochemistry values.
The patient was requested to treat a fungal infection in which a submucosal polyp was removed and internal hemorrhoids were observed.
