A 39-year-old white woman was referred to our department for investigation of possible vasculitis.
She suffered a decrease in visual acuity for several years and nictalopia.
Personal history included episodes of epilepsy in childhood, food and latex allergy, dermal disorders (follicle), doubtful oral aphthae and living with a domestic animal (dog).
The visual acuity with correction in the right eye (OD) was 0.4 (+1.75S -2.5C to 175o) and in the left eye 0.4 (+1.25S -1.5C to 15 Snellen).
The biomycosis was normal in both eyes.
Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg in both eyes.
In the eye fundus peripheral pigmentosa is observed (peripheral and central mycosis in bicycle radios), vitreous veils, reticular microcystic degeneration in peripheral media, peripheral arbortion and peripheral vascular degeneration
Serological tests and analysis of histocompatibility molecules were normal.
Fluorescence angiography showed diffuse parenchymal impregnation, contrast leakage of perifoveal capillary vessels and peripheral vascular changes in both eyes.
OCT (Stratus OCT model 3000 [Humprey Zeiss instrument]) showed correction of foveal depression with thickening of the posterior hyaloids.
A Cadwell [surface electrode], Nihon Kohden (collection device) electroretinogram was requested, showing a bilateral alteration in the amplitude of the atopic waves.
1.
Evoked potentials were normal.
