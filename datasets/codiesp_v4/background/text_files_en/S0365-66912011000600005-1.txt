A 65-year-old woman diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 with a viral load of 4.300,000 copies/ml and hypertension.
Treatment with pegylated IFN alpha-2b (180Î¼g/week) was initiated with ribavirin (800mg/day).
Due to her history of hypertension, an exploration was requested which was performed 15 days after the start of treatment.
He had a visual acuity (VA) of 10/10 with correction in both eyes and in the eye fundus (FO): normal papillae and maculae.
Venous stenosis and tortuosity with arteriovenous pathological crossings.
At 3 months, and being asymptomatic, she was reevaluated.
The same was observed in the FO, but multiple cotton-wool exudates appeared in the arches and posterior pole, with respect to macular area, as well as some microaneurism and microaneurism area.
Epidermitis due to IFN was labelled and it was decided to continue with the treatment given the null impact on the VA, high viral load and the possibility of close monitoring.
1.
Virological response was delayed by week 24, and treatment was continued for 72 weeks with good response.
Neutropenia occurred during treatment, which reached a maximum of 600/mm3 and anemia a maximum of 8.5g/dl of hemoglobin, but the doses of IFN did not change.
In the successive controls the same VA was always maintained, the exudates were gradually reduced and only a microarray remained in the superior temporal vascular arch of the right eye.
