A two-and-a-half-year-old boy was referred from the rural area of Puerto Leguzamo.
The patient was taken to the Hospital de Marciatica due to a 15-day history of high intermittent fever, asthenia and adynamia.
Physical examination revealed fever, multiple lymphadenopathies and mild hepatosplenomegaly.
A thick blood smear was performed to identify trypomastigotes of T. cruzi.
Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were normal.
The clinical picture improved rapidly, etiological treatment was initiated with benznidazole at a dose of 100 mg/day for 60 days.
The diagnosis was confirmed in the INS by smear layer of peripheral blood and positive culture one month later.
The initial serology with IFI technique at five days of symptoms was negative, but a second, at two weeks, was positive with a result of 1:64.
In a field study, neither vectors nor other infected patients were identified whose samples were subjected to extended peripheral blood and serology.
