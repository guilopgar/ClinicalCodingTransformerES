A 46-year-old male patient, with no relevant past medical history, came to the outpatient clinic of our center because of a 12-month history of ventral penile bullet of progressive growth.
The patient complained of urethral meatus when white material was removed, achieving a slight decrease in volume and tension of the nodule, without accompanying voiding syndrome and uncomfortable sensation in relationships.
On physical examination, an elastic nodule is observed for ventral subglandar urethral fixation lateralized to the right, 1.5 cm in diameter, mobile and cystic consistency.
Complementary examinations were performed:
- Magnetic resonance imaging: a 2x2x1.8cm image at baseline at the distal end of the penis with compression and distortion of the cystic corpus on the right side.
A hyperintense line is observed, which is directed to contact the anterior penile urethra with possible communication of cystic image with the urethra.
1.
- retrograde and voiding urethrography: with normal anterior urethral channel.
Urethra-prostatic elongation.
Trabeculate bladder with correct opening of the bladder neck and easy contrast step throughout the urethra.
Absence of relapse.
It was decided to perform a surgical procedure with excision of the cystic formation very fixed to the right body without observing any communication with the urethra, but with clear dependence on it.
When the cyst was opened, a white liquid material was removed, without harmonic appearance and with detritus.
1.
The pathology reports connective tissue with mild mononuclear infiltrate lined by keratinizing squamous epithelium.
The patient is currently asymptomatic, with good micturation and presence of normal and satisfactory signs and symptoms.
