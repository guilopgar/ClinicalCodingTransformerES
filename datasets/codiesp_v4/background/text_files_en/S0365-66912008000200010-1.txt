A 66-year-old male patient with no relevant past medical history presented with left eye myodesopsias of several days duration.
The visual acuity was 0.9 in right eye (OD) and 0.8 in left eye.
Ocular tension was 20 mmHg in the RE and 16 mmHg in the LE.
Anterior pole exploration was normal in both eyes.
The right eye fundus was normal.
The left eye fundus showed subretinal mastication exudates affecting the nasal and superior temporal retina.
In the retina affected by the exudates, irregular dilations of the blood vessels were visible, which were more evident on fluorescein angiography.
The diagnosis of Coats disease in adults was established and laser photocoagulation of vascular alterations of the superior temporal retina was performed due to the risk of exudation in this area of progression to the macula.
In the nasal retina, laser photocoagulation was performed on those vascular alterations that were more easily identifiable visually.
Six months after treatment, the patient maintains the same visual acuity and a moderate decrease of the hard exudates located in the superior temporal arch is observed.
Nasal exudation has barely changed (5).
