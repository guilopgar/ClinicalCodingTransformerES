A 73-year-old man was admitted to the otorhinolaryngology service with recurrent epistasis for one week.
As a background, only to mention that he had undergone left nephrectomy 17 years earlier due to a renal mass of 8.5 cm in the upper pole of the left kidney.
The histological report was clear cell carcinoma.
In the extension studies at that time, no metastatic lesion was detected at that time.
Physical examination showed intense bleeding through the right nasal orifice associated with right eyeball proptosis.
A scan showed a mass in the right nasal cavity and right orbit.
An examination under anesthesia with biopsy was performed confirming the origin of renal cell carcinoma of the mass.
Angiographic study showed marked neovascularization in the right sinus and right nasal cavity involving the right internal maxillary artery, as well as the right ophthalmic artery and branches.
Embolization of the right internal maxillary artery was performed without achieving effective control of bleeding.
The patient died days later due to hypovolemic shock.
