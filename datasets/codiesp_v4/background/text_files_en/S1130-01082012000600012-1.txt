We report the case of a 37-year-old HIV patient with CD4 counts < 100/mm3 who was admitted for fever and diarrhea.
During admission she continued with persistent diarrhea and significant malnutrition secondary to it despite parenteral nutrition.
She also had severe pancreatitis, cholestatic hepatitis and clinical features compatible with adrenal insufficiency.
In the study of diarrhea, normal stool analysis, endoscopic gastroscopy and double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) were performed orally until the middle ileum without finding mucosal lesions.
Biopsies were taken at different levels.
Biopsies taken from the terminal and middle ileum by DBE allowed the establishment of a definitive diagnosis for chronic inflammation by Leishmania.
