A 62-year-old Asian man was admitted for hepatomegaly and jaundice (bilirubin 23.6 mg/dl), with GPT/GOT 1.301/506 IU/l and GGT 527 IU/l.
Vascular, obstructive, infectious and autoimmune diseases were excluded.
Liver biopsy was compatible with EVOH.
The patient suffered from constipation until the previous consumption, usual and on admission, of over-the-counter unlabeled "laxative" capsules obtained in China without sanitary control.
An analysis carried out at the Inadequacy and Control Department showed that proline, anthraquinones and other non-identifiable compounds were present.
After discharge, asymptomatic, only mild stasis persisted (GGT 170 IU/l, Bb 1.9 mg/dl).
