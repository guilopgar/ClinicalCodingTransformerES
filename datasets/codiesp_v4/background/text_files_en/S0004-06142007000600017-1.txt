A 41-year-old patient, without known allergies, with a history of bilateral hearing loss, childhood hepatitis, hyperuricemia.
He was operated on in the childhood of left cryptorchidism, without finding the test.
In August 2004 she underwent surgery for a retroperitoneal mass of 8 cm, with histological result of Seminoma, stage II-C.
Markers were negative (alphafetoprotein, beta HCG and LDH).
She was treated with Carboplatin-based chemotherapy for hearing loss.
Radiotherapy was ruled out.
The patient was followed-up every 6 months, with imaging tests performed by tocoabdominal computed tomography and tumor markers.
The post-chemotherapy CT scan was normal and the next 6 months later also.
In June 2006, 14 months after the end of chemotherapy, a solid soft tissue formation was found, which was interpreted as a recurrence of the seminoma and was treated with 10 sessions of chemotherapy, with no changes in the CT scan.
During the intervention, the resection of a mesentery mass involved the border of a small intestine loop and the removal of a small intestine loop of about 20 cm affected by smaller implants of lesions in small months.
Histopathological examination showed a solid tumor of 8.5 x 7 cm with a homogeneous surface of whitish coloration and histological sections showed a densely cellular solid tumor made up of spindle cells with separated collagenous stroma.
The immunohistochemical study performed when considering the differential diagnosis between a desmoid tumor and a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, showed positivity for Vimentin, negativity for CD34, Desmin and cKit.
Ki67 shows a low proliferation index, concluding that it was a Desmoid Tumor.
