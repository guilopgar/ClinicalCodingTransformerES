We report the case of a 78-year-old phakic patient diagnosed with exudative age-related macular degeneration (EAMD) in the right eye who underwent photodynamic therapy (PDT).
48 hours later, she was injected in a glass chamber 20 mg of 0.1 ml triamcinolone acetate obtained by sedimentation technique.
The operation was performed in the operating room under aseptic measures.
The injection was made with a 27 G needle at 4 mm from the limbus in the temporo-inferior quadrant helped by a blepharostat.
During the procedure, when closing the eyelids with an attempt to close, it was observed that part of the affected substance was passed through the anterior chamber.
It was decided to act expectantly instilling ciprofloxacin eye drops and observing spontaneous arterial pulse.
The next day the patient presented with a precipitated triad in the anterior chamber and in the vitreous chamber without other inflammatory signs.
IOP was 25 mm Hg, so we prescribed 0.5% thymolol maleate in eye drops every 12 hours.
1.
Controls were carried out in which a decrease in IOP was detected to normal values, a periodic progressive resorption of the triad and transparent cornea without inflammatory reaction.
Two months later there were few remnants of the substance, the IOP was 17 mm Hg without treatment and the biomycosis endothelial was a normal cell count and the same as in the contralateral eye.
