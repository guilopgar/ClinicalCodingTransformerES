A 56-year-old male diagnosed 10 years ago with Cowden's disease presenting multiple papillomatous formations on the dorsum of the tongue of variable size, tongue thrust macroglossia and mucous-shaped papules in mucosa.
The pathological result was fibroepithelial (12).
1.
After the dermatological diagnosis the following extension study was carried out: a) EGD transit and opaque enema showing numerous thyroid nodules diagnosed rectally: glycosylated rectal ampulla; b) histologically matching upper and lower lobe:
After puncture (PAAF), a diagnosis of goiter was made; computerized tomography (d) was performed and showed no significant alterations.
Currently the patient consults for headache.
Given his disease magnetic resonance imaging was performed and there was no evidence of a cortical region in the right cerebellar hemisphere described as an increase in volume due to the presence of a poorly defined mass that showed mild left ventricular dislodgement.
After the administration of paramagnetic contrast there is no significant uptake, so it seems to be a cerebellar dysplastic gangliocytoma with thickening of the apparent layer of cerebellum.
