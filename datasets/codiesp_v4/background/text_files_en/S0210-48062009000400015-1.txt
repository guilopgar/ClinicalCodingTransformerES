An 82-year-old woman was admitted three days after suffering a casual fall at home and was bedridden at home during this time.
You have a complex pelvic ring fracture, other multiple fractures in your limbs, and severe hyponatremia.
CT scan showed an extraperitoneal breakage of the bladder with a left ischion bone imprint, without significant perivesical leakage.
Due to the age and time elapsed since the trauma, we opted for conservative treatment of fractures, and permanent catheterization until healing of extraperitoneal bladder injury, remaining in charge of the Nephrology Service to compensate for the electrolytic disorders.
After 25 days of hospitalization she presented fever episodes and a left inguinal abscess was found with a fistulous tract to the anterior aspect of the thigh, and a new CT showed persistence of the bladder rupture with contrast abscess, due to the fistula tract.
The abscess was drained and the bladder was surgically repaired, with wound healing without sequelae.
