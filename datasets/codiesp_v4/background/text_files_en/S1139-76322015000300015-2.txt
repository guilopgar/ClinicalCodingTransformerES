A previously healthy girl, with no personal history of interest, is correctly vaccinated.
At 23 months she has a first episode of parotid swelling.
Clinical picture of fever and inflammation in the parotid region that erased the mandibular angle, without inflammatory signs or suppuration in the Stenon duct.
Blood tests showed leukocytosis (19 700/mm3) with neutrophilia (65%), CRP 5.45 mg/dl and amylase 881 U/l.
An ultrasound showed bilateral inflammation of both parotid glands, without stenosis.
She was admitted for intravenous antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, analgesia and sedation.
Given the good evolution, she was discharged three days later to continue the treatment on an outpatient basis.
Subsequently, she has presented successive episodes (four more) of similar clinical and analytical characteristics, which have been treated with antibiotics on an outpatient basis with good evolution.
These are episodes of approximately one week duration, bilateral, but predominantly affecting the left side.
The patient was followed up in the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Department where the study was completed.
All serology and rheumatoid tests were negative.
Ultrasounds showing glandular enlargement with heterogeneous hypoechogenic photos are repeated.
Currently without new episodes.
