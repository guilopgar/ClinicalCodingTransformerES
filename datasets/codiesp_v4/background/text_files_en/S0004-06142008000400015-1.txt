A 17-year-old patient under paediatric nephrology control presented with seizures and tuberous sclerosis characterized by psychomotor retardation and a known presence of renal angiomyolipomas.
When the patient was asymptomatic, a routine CT scan showed a lesion of less than 5 mm in the right kidney in the interpolar region, and another 4 x 4 cm in the inferior pole of the same kidney homogeneously uptake.
This finding was surgically removed by subcostal incision, with at least 5 solid tumors measuring between 0.5 and 4 cm. Tumorectomy was performed in all lesions.
The postoperative period was satisfactory and the patient was discharged after 4 days.
The anatomopathological finding in 4 of the neoformations, including the largest one, was compatible with angiomyolipoma of epithelioid type, showing cells of epithelioid appearance and presenting positive HMB45 and actin negative staining.
Only one of the excised tumors was compatible with a classic AML.
At 24 months the patient is asymptomatic without progression data.
