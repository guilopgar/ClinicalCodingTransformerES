A 45-year-old patient, with no history of interest, who 15 days prior to the current admission had consulted the emergency department for abdominal pain and diarrhea, being advised as acute gastroenteritis and treated with an antibiotic.
Due to the persistence of abdominal pain and pseudodiarrhoea symptoms, she again consulted the hospital.
Abdominal examination was compatible with mechanical intestinal subocclusion.
Laboratory tests revealed mild leukocytosis and elevated CRP.
Microbiological studies of feces were performed, all of them negative.
An abdominal CAT scan showed a large endocardial lesion measuring 3.5 x 9 cm at the level of descending sigma/colon, fat and radiolucent features, all of which are very suggestive of a tumor
The clinical and radiological correlation allowed us to conclude the diagnosis of subocclusion of the left colon secondary to fat-free tumor.
It was decided to surgically intervene within 24-48 h, given the clinical stability.
At 24 h the patient presented worsening of abdominal pain, followed by spontaneous exacerbation of an anorectal mass.
The mass was risky and recoverable for histological study.
The Expanded Mass was characterized by a thick brownish surface measuring 70 x 50 x 45 mm.
After the tumor was excised, the patient was completely asymptomatic and a new abdominal CT scan showed the disappearance of the tumor without signs of perforation.
The patient was discharged 48 hours later and a laparotomy was performed.
Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of submucosal meningitis.
