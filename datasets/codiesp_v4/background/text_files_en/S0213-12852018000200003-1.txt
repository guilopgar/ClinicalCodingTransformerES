It is presented to a private clinic in Talca, Chile, a female patient of 10 years.
The extraoral examination showed no relevant information and the intraoral examination showed an increase of hard consistency volume, in buccal of tooth 3.3, of two months of evolution.
Panoramic radiography shows a radiolucent lesion with defined edges, corticalized, located distal to the root of tooth 3.3 and mesial to tooth 3.4.
This lesion causes displacement of the root of the 3.4 tooth distally.
Its dimensions are approximately 1.0 x 1.1 x 1.8 cm.
The occlusal radiograph shows the expansion of the buccal bone plate, maintaining the cortical.
Intraoral radiographs show radiopacities inside the lesion, almost imperceptible.
It was decided to perform a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).
CBCT examination revealed a mixed lesion with hypodense vestibular area and irregular hyperdense areas inside.
The expansion of buccal bone plate is observed in relation to tooth 3.3.
The presence of radiopacities within the lesion was confirmed.
Based on these findings, three differential diagnoses are proposed, ossifying fibroma, AOT, odontoma in initial stage formation.
Complete enucleation of the lesion is performed as treatment.
Histopathological analysis confirms the diagnosis of AOT.
A control X-ray was performed at 2 years, in which no signs of recurrence were observed.
