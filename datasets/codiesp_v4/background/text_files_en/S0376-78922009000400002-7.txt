A 60-year-old woman with a 1-year history of ossifying sarcoma in the lower portion of the right paraspinal region and involvement of 5 costal arches.
Tumor exeresis was performed, resulting in a 10 x 15 cm defect in the posterior region of the chest, which included partial removal of the posterior arches of 3 vertebrae.
The patient received intraoperative radiotherapy and then immediate reconstruction was performed using a Gore-texÂ® sandwich-shaped envelope with a rectus abdominis muscle flap, deepidermized, horizontally rotated skin with rib.
The rotation allowed the flap to run above the right hemidiaphragm to cover without incidents the medial zone flap.
The patient was discharged 10 days after surgery, with no complications.
After 18 months postoperatively, there were no signs of disease recurrence and there were no ventilatory alterations.
