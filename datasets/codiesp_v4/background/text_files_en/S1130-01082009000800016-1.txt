A 44-year-old woman presented with a one-month history of constant abdominal pain puncture in the right iliac fossa, accompanied by melenas and episodes of hematochexia 24 hours before admission.
Physical examination revealed pain on palpation of the right iliac fossa, with no signs of peritoneal irritation.
Selected colitis showed a neoplasic mass in the right colon, which bleeds easily, and biopsies showed severe ulcerated chronic disease.
Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a tumoral lesion in the cecum and ascending colon. The density of these lesions was 0.50, and they were related to a urticarial antigen.
The patient continued with melenic stools, and due to the clinical suspicion of colon carcinoma, right hemicolectomy was performed with ileotransverse thermolateral anastomosis.
A 4.5 x 3.5 cm diameter cecal mass covered by an ulcerated mucosa was identified in the surgical specimen.
Histopathological examination revealed a lesion composed of a large quantity of mature adipocytes arranged on a finely collagenized and vascularized stroma, which originated in submucosal and protruding intestinal lumen.
This lesion was covered by inflamed colonic mucosa with reactive and ulcerated epithelium.
The patient is currently asymptomatic.
