A 51-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a five-day history of decreased visual acuity in his left eye.
As a personal history the patient had non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus of six years of evolution, as well as having suffered a blunt trauma in the same eye 15 years before.
She reported asymptomatic loss of vision for five days in her left eye.
Visual acuity (VA) measured by the Snellen test was 1 for his right eye and 0.5 for his left eye, improving the latter to 1 with a spherical correction of +1.5D.
Both intrinsic ocular motility, biomycosis anterior and coughing of the patient were normal.
Funduscopy of the eye under study showed a juxtapapular, erythematous blistering, elevated, well-defined mass.
An alteration of the pigment epithelium in the macular region was also observed, as well as an alteration of the upper and lower nerve fiber layer.
Adelphic examination of the eye revealed mild alteration of the pigment epithelium.
Fluorescein angiography was performed which demonstrated the filling of an intratumoral vascular tree composed of thin capillaries with exudate in late times, confirming the first suspicion of capillary hemangioma juxtapapil.
There were leakage points in the posterior pole of both eyes, suggestive of central serous pathology.
A standard 24-2 SITA visual field (Zeiss-Humphrey Instruments, Dublin, CA) with corrected vision, stimulus III was performed, finding an infero-nasal defect in the left eye.
Four weeks later, the vision of the left eye was 0.6 corrected (+0.5 esf + 1 x 48 cil) 1; while the vision of the right eye was 0.4 corrected + 0.625 esf + 170.
A new fluorescein angiography showed that decreased right eye visual acuity was due to central serous retinopathy.
Eight weeks after the onset of symptoms, spontaneous regression of both juxtapapillary capillary hemangioma and bilateral serous central cardiomyopathy was found, returning VA to 1 difficult in both eyes.
