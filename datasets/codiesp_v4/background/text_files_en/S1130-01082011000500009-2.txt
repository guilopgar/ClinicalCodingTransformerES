A 41-year-old male smoker, 26 years old, was diagnosed with ileocolic CD.
During follow-up, she presented a perianal fistula and an intestinal subocclusion secondary to a sprout of her CD, resulting in an enterovesical fistula that required surgical intervention (ileocolic resection).
Coinciding with the subocclusion picture, she began with lower limb edema, impaired renal function and proteinuria in nephrotic range, performing a renal biopsy that confirmed the suspicion of renal AA.
She was treated with colchicine with clinical and renal function improvement.
CRE recurred in the anastomosis being treated with azathioprine, which has controlled intestinal disease, although perianal fistula persists oligosymptomatically.
At present, he remains on treatment with azathioprine plus tablelacin, presenting normal renal function, with persistence of proteinuria in non-nephrotic range.
