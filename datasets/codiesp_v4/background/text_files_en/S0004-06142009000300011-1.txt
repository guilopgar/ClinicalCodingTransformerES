We report the case of a 49-year-old woman with no history of interest, who came to the emergency department of our hospital, because she referred the introduction of a metallic object in the genital area in the context of erotic-sexual practices.
Clinically the patient was asymptomatic, and in the genital exploration no material was observed inside the vagina.
A metallic object that stood out from the contour of the urinary bladder was observed in the simple abdominal X-ray.
Ultrasound was finally performed, followed by abdominal CT, which showed an 8 cm long metallic object lodged inside the right pelvic ureter.

The patient was operated on and a cystoscopy was performed under general anesthesia, finding a metallic cylinder protruding from the interior of the right ureteral orifice.
If the object could not be removed endoscopically, an infraumbilical midline laparotomy was performed, opening the bladder and removing a metallic cylinder of 8 cm in length, corresponding to a profile.
