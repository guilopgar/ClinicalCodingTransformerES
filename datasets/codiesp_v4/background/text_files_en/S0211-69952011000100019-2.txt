A 41-year-old patient with a history of arterial hypertension (AHT) since the age of 20 years with difficult control and poor therapeutic compliance.
He had been diagnosed in 2008 with chronic renal failure due to probable nephroangiopathy.
A peritoneal catheter was implanted in December 2009, starting continuous ambulatory PD 15 days later without remarkable incidents.
One month later, the patient came to consultation due to peritoneal catheter dysfunction, with significant difficulty for drainage.
Physical examination revealed hypoventilation to the midfield in the right lung.
The patient reported dyspnea, although with good oxygen saturation, with evidence of significant right pleural effusion on chest X-ray.
1.
Diagnosis of hydrothorax secondary to PD was established by diagnostic ultrasound, obtaining a pleural fluid with the following data: leukocytes 200.
Glucose 418.
<1, LDH
Since the patient refused to undergo hemodialysis, after a few days of peritoneal rest with which a catheter was placed and the chest X-ray was normalized, an attempt was made to perform PD with low volume and to achieve a good drainage at 45.
Finally, the patient agreed to undergo HD, which at the present time is performed without incidents through the left radiocephalic fistula.
