A 32-year-old woman, without any medical pathology or previous surgical interventions, underwent an abdominal ultrasound control during her pregnancy.
In this case, a supravesical cystic mass was observed on the urachus path, in close contact with the homogeneous bladder dome and contained within it.
The patient had not presented any symptoms related to this casual ultrasound finding.
It was decided to stop the pregnancy and after delivery abdominal MRI was performed to better assess the case.
With the presumptive diagnosis of urachal cyst, surgical intervention is proposed, performing an infraumbilical laparotomy with a tapered tape, or excision of a piece of 11x5.5 cm, located between fibromuscular
Cutting showed cystic characteristics, with mucinous nodules within the lesion.
