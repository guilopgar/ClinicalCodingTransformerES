A three-year-old male patient was referred to the maxillofacial surgery service of Luis Calvo Mackenna Hospital for presenting a lesion in the right malar area.
With no morbid history, he reported that three months ago he presented volume increase secondary to trauma in the right malar region and persisting to date.
1.
On examination, the patient presented an asymptomatic, circumscribed, firm increase in volume, with undetermined evolution time.
Upon intraoral examination, the vestibule was observed to be characterized by thickening and increased volume of the bone ridge in the highest area.
A mass is observed in the axial tomography (CAT) that compromises the right bone, affecting the adjacent bone, part of the floor of the orbit and the arch with a bad computerized region.
Incisional biopsy of the lesion was performed.
1.
Biopsy results showed LCH with intensely positive immunohistochemical markers CD1a and S100.
A complete study of the patient was performed without evidence of involvement in other areas of the body.
1.
The lesion was classified as a single bone lesion of special site and treated with the corresponding protocol, receiving 4 weeks of prednisone and 6 doses of vinblastine.
Subsequently, local curettage was performed after curettage.
18 months after the treatment, the patient is asymptomatic, with no increase in facial volume or bone ridge.
The control CT scan showed bony regeneration of malar bone, the tapered arch and the orbital floor.
