An 80-year-old patient with a history of mitral valve disease, pulmonary hypertension and atrial fibrillation was studied for asthenia and iron deficiency anemia.
Histopathological examination revealed a polylobular vegetative lesion occupying 60-70 % of the cecal lumen, with a result of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
The CT scan showed a cecal narrowing of 5.8 x 4.9 cm, marked without signs of obstruction.
A 22 x 29 x 21 mm sand clockwise, which grew through the spinal canal, widening the orifice between D1-D2 layers was observed.
Median ultrasound-guided needle biopsy was performed 3 times the lesion was softened from the face of the esophagus, observing a rounded 30-mm diameter mass in the right paraspinal position, hyperechogenic 25-mm thick with echogenic.
The puncture was performed without aspiration syringe, by slow withdrawal technique of the stylet and outward movements, with pathologist in situ, obtaining sufficient material to establish the diagnosis of CK TT3- receptors with medium size collagen receptors (inmunologist in situ).
A right hemicolectomy was performed with diagnosis of blind adenocarcinoma, without involvement in the 11 resected lymph nodes or risk factors (pT2 pN0 Mx).
It was recommended to start reviews, not finding signs of local or distant relapse after 3 years of follow-up to date.
