We report the case of a 77-year-old woman who came to our clinic for hair loss in frontotemporal and parietal areas as well as scalp pruritus.
The patient reported that she had "the increasingly broad forehead" and for months she had noticed a significant hair loss at that level.
Physical examination revealed a regression in the frontal hairline implantation, the presence of terminal hairs in isolation in the alopecia band, and bilateral regression at the temporal level.
An analytical study was requested without finding relevant changes.
The patient was referred to the pathology service where the diagnosis of frontal fibrosing alopecia was made and treatment with topical corticosteroids and 5Î±-reductase inhibitors (finasteride at a dose of 2.5mg/day) was initiated.
Five months after the beginning of the treatment, the patient showed stabilization of the disease and great improvement in pruritus.
