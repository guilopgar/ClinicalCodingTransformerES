A ten-year-old girl, with no history of interest, who, without remembering previous trauma, consulted due to a painful tumor in the left thigh that had been noticed two days earlier.
There is no fever, weight loss or other symptoms.
Physical examination revealed a painful tumour measuring 7 Ã— 11 cm in the mid-distal third of the left thigh.
The limb is minimally increased in size compared to the contralateral limb.
Skin color and temperature are normal.
The rest of the physical examination is normal.
Clinical findings were obtained with a plain radiograph of the left foot showing a calcified mass.
Subsequently, an ultrasound of the thigh is requested, which shows an oval image with multiple hyperechogenic images inside that cause posterior acoustic shadowing, which does not suggest a definitive diagnosis.
To specify the diagnosis, a computed tomography (CT) is requested, which shows a calcified mass that does not include neuromuscular structures, of apparently benign characteristics, but does not rule out the possibility of a soft tissue chondroma.

The possibility of malignancy is derived to a third level hospital for evaluation, where the case is reassessed.
A family member recalls a bicycle handler injury about four months before the initial visit, followed by pain and inflammation seven days later.
The case was initially referred to as a calcified hematoma and conservative treatment and a follow-up visit three months later are suggested.
After this time, they request a simple control X-ray that shows no changes from the previous one.
The clinical course reassessed the initial CT scan and reoriented the diagnosis as traumatic ossifying myositis (TMM).
Four years later the lesion has barely diminished in size, but surgery is not considered because the patient is clinically asymptomatic.
