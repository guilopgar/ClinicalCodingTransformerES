In 1999, at the age of 66, a mastectomy with left axillary dissection was performed.
Histological diagnosis was moderately differentiated ductal carcinoma 1.5 cm in size (T1c).
Eight lymph nodes were isolated, 3 affected by the disease.
Estrogen and progesterone receptors were positive.
She received complementary chemotherapy (six cycles of MFC) and subsequently radiotherapy and hormone treatment with tamoxifen.
During the last months of 2004 metrorrhagia began to occur in small quantities.
In January 2005, bone pain was added.
The biopsy taken by hysteroscopy was reported as mucinous adenocarcinoma poorly differentiated with signet ring cells, compatible with primary cervical tumor.
Extension studies showed metastatic bone and liver involvement.
Although it was initially proposed as a second primary tumor of endocervical origin, clinical data and the simultaneous presence of bone and liver involvement recommended a reassessment of histology.
Immunohistochemical studies showed positivity for estrogen and progesterone receptors in the endocervical biopsy specimen, which led to interpret the whole picture as distant dissemination of breast cancer.
Currently, she receives palliative treatment with chemotherapy.
