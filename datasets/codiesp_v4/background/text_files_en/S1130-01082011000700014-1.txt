A 23-year-old patient with a history of excision of cutaneous melanoma and left axillary lymphadenectomy for metastatic lymphadenopathy of one year duration, was treated with adjuvant interferon.
She was admitted due to severe vasogenic oedema and midline shift secondary to a single cerebral metastasis in the left parietal lobe.
During this admission the patient developed abdominal dysperitoneum with pain and defense of the right iliac fossa (IDF), and abdominal radiology showed loops of the small intestine and descending colon that had TAC.
These findings underwent emergency surgery for generalized peritonitis secondary to perforation of the small intestine in three segments located in the proximal and distal cutaneous melanomas and in the distal ileum, in relation to metastatic implants
Resection of the affected intestine was performed.
Postoperative course was satisfactory and the patient was discharged on day 10.
The pathological study confirmed the diagnosis of intestinal metastasis of malignant cutaneous melanoma.
The patient died 5 months later at home due to disease progression.
