A 15-month-old girl of African origin was diagnosed with a striking bilateral symmetrical genu varus in the childcare review.
She has no relevant medical or family history.
He has normal psychomotor development.
It is derived to the Traumatology Service, where a radiological study is performed confirming the alteration in the metaphyseal-diaphyseal angle, with a marked internal tibial torsion component and an alteration of the tibial proximal growth plate.
The study was completed with analysis of bone metabolism, with normal results.
Initial treatment was started without improvement after ten months of follow-up, so it was decided to perform corrective surgical treatment (osteotomy distal tibial derotation and subsequently good proximal valgus osteotomy).
Subsequent controls are favorable, maintaining a correct alignment of both extremities.
