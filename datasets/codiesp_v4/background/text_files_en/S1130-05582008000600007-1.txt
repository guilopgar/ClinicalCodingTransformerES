A 17-year-old woman suffered a traffic accident on September 25, 2004 with a panfacial fracture.
Open reduction and internal fixation of the fractures were performed 1 month after the trauma due to the neurological condition of the patient.
Postsurgical sequelae: enophthalmos, seizures and left epiphora.
Twenty months after the intervention, the patient underwent simultaneous correction of the enophthalmos and post-traumatic arthritis, using a staggered orbital footing graft.
Both in the immediate postoperative evaluation and 42 weeks postoperatively, there is evidence of correction of enophthalmos and seizures.
