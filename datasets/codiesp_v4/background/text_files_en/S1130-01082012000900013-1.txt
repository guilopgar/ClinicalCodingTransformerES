We report the case of a 78-year-old woman with painless urgencies of recent onset.
Abdominal CT shows dilation of the bile duct; after performing endoscopic ultrasound and ERCP with biopsy is diagnosed as adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater.
A pancreaticoduodenodenectomy was performed (PDC) with reconstruction to Whipple, with pancreatic-jejunal anastomosis on polypropylene mesh, according to the technique described by Wang (10).
Postoperative course was uneventful.
The histology of the lesion confirmed the existence of a mucosecretory adenocarcinoma with areas of signet ring cells at the level of the ampulla of Vater, with a diffuse pattern of 1.1-cm lesions up to the pancreatic layer 1 with the wall but without the lesion.
The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine.
After 14 months of follow-up she remains disease free.
