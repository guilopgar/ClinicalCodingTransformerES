A 73-year-old woman who had been admitted to the internal medicine ward after having undergone surgery for acute diverticulum perforated with perisigmoid abscess.
The cause of admission to the ICU was recurrent tonic-clonic seizures, so OTI was ruled out.
Subsequently, it was observed that the cause of the seizures was low cost due to a heart rhythm disorder (secondary AVDD grade III paroxysmal AVDD), so cardiac block was implanted.
On the sixth day of intubation he was extubated, and in the first hours after extubation he developed left massive atelectasis, with a pO2/FiO2 ratio of 120 with a Venturi mask that was 50% (10 bpm) CPAP.
The described protocol was applied and the procedure could be successfully performed; large amounts of secretions were aspirated and atelectasis was resolved.
Chest radiography was performed before and after the procedure.
In subsequent cultures of the samples obtained, Acinetobacter baumanni was isolated and colonization was considered, given the absence of other signs of infection (fever, leukocytosis, new infiltrates on chest X-ray).
