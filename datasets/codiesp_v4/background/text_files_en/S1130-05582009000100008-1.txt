A 55-year-old male patient attended our outpatient clinic due to ocular globe exophthalmos secondary to a tumor in the right maxillary sinus.
As a history, the patient reported a right malar-malar fracture 28, in which reduction and fixation was performed in the ridge and infraorbital arc years before.
In the exploration, we found exophthalmos, vertical tracing of the ocular globe and depletion in the vertical gaze.
Infraorbital ridge deficiency was found which allowed identifying a soft mass at this level.
Orthopantomography showed no relationship between the mass and teeth.
CT showed a soft tissue mass of approximately 3.5 cm in the right maxillary sinus, well delimited, with bone exposition and destruction of the orbital floor and displacement of the inferior rectus muscle.
1.
The surgical intervention consisted of excision of the lesion associated with removal of the wireless fixation via sub-borda Figure 3, and stenting with Med prosthesis of the complex infraorbital fibroma arboporosis floor complex (frontal reconstruction).

The pathological study confirmed the diagnosis of maxillary mucocele.
1.
The evolution of the patient was satisfactory, with good ocular motility, without diplopia and with a correct aesthetic result.
The current follow-up after three years remains satisfactory without recurrence or complications.
