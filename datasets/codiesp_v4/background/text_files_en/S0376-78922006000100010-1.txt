An 85-year-old woman with a history of recurrent basal cell carcinoma in the right ear.
Initial treatment, performed in May 2001, consisted of local excision of the lesion.
The patient underwent periodic reviews and after 2 years she had a local recurrence and a tumor at the right submandibular level.
Cytology of the tumor was requested by puncture aspiration with needle, which was reported as positive for malignant cells, compatible with metastasis of basal cell carcinoma.
Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT) shows a thickening of the blade tissues of the right auricular pavilion in relation to the history of previous neoplasia.
An infra-parotid nodule measuring 1.5 cm in diameter with central necrosis and an impression of localized adenopathy was also observed.
The rest of the examination was normal.
1.
In June 2003, partial resection of the superficial lobe of the parotid gland was performed, as well as selective right cervical dissection confined to zones 2 and 3, and excision of the lower half of the pinna, which included local recurrence.
Final pathology reported the tumor as a metastasis of basal cell carcinoma subtype affecting the parotid gland with free resection margins.
Among the 10 cervical lymph nodes isolated, 2 were affected.
Local recurrence of the pinna was also reported as basal cell epithelioma with free margins.
The patient was referred for radiotherapy treatment.
At the time of this publication there is no evidence of recurrence and the patient remains alive.
