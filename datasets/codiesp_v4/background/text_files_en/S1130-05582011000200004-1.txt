A 32-year-old male with no history of relevant diseases, no toxic habits or known drug allergies.
He underwent surgery in another center for dentofacial deformity two years before consulting us.
Maxillary advance osteotomies and osteosyntesis with 2 miniplates and mandibular retrusion and osteosyntesis were performed to stabilize the fragments with 2 other miniplates, one at each side at the mandibular level.
During the intervention, 2 g of amoxiclavulanic acid was administered and, for 10 days after surgery, the patient received antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin 875/125 administered orally every 8 hours.
The patient reported follow-up visits after the intervention at one week and one month, with a normal evolution in which facial inflammation remits, without signs of local infection.
After 3 months the patient reported having started to present a solid tumor under the right mandibular angle with episodes of mild pain and local inflammation of 5 days of evolution and a periodicity of twice a month.
Two years after the surgery, the patient came to our service and in the examination a solid tumor of about 5 cm in diameter caudal to the right submaxillary cell was observed. This tumor continued with an induration of the right mandibular cord.
Magnetic resonance imaging and cervical computed tomography (CT) report possible inflammatory adenopathy or vascular tumor.
Magnetic resonance angiography does not rule out the possibility of cervical vascular tumor.
Ultrasound describes it as a solid tumor.
Orthopantomography is normal without signs of osteomyelitis.
A needle aspiration biopsy was performed and the result was lymphocytosis.
