A 77-year-old patient presented to the emergency department complaining of pain in both eyes (OA), with no loss of visual acuity (VA).
He also says that he has been experiencing discomfort for a few days alternately in both eyes.
There was no family history of interest and among the personal highlights an ischemic heart disease 3 years ago in treatment with: Pravastatin 10 mg/24 hours, Atenol 50 mg/12 hours, Ranipricidol 2.5 mg/24 hours, A
As the closest personal history, it should be noted that two weeks after starting with the problems, the patient had been admitted to the internal medicine service with a diagnosis of pneumonia in the upper right lobe treated with Moxifloxacin for 10 days.
After hospital discharge, without antibiotic treatment, the patient complained of ocular discomfort alternately in OA.
In the exploration, the objective was to achieve a VA in the right eye (RE) of 0.6 which improved to 0.8 with correction and in the left eye (LE) of 0.3 which improved to 0.6 with correction.
In the anterior segment there is an inflammatory reaction in the anterior chamber of AO (Tyndall's phenomenon of cells +1 and proteins +1), and a strong dispersion of pigment (+/+ all of them in the trabecular meshwork).
Ocular tension was 9 mm Hg in RE and 8 mmHg in LE.
The eye fundus, under pharmacological mydriasis, was normal, and there was no inflammatory reaction in the vitreous chamber.
A clinical history was made, within the uveitis protocol followed in our department, which included an anamnesis by equipment and the request of directed complementary examinations, systematic blood, thorax, VDRL, FTA-abs.
Mydriasis and topical corticosteroids were started, yielding the pigment in numerous structures of the anterior segment and maintaining an intraocular pressure of 14 mmHg in successive reviews.
The complementary examinations did not detect any significant alteration.
