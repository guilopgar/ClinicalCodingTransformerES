We report the case of an 18-year-old male with a history of functional bicuspid aorta who came to the emergency department for colic type painINE 72 hours of evolution, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 8 hours.
The patient reported similar previous episodes.
At the time of admission, the patient presented arterial pressure of 120 mmHg and a protodiastolic murmur I/IV, with the rest of the normal examination.
Blood tests showed urea 71 mg/dl, creatinine 3.69 mg/dl, Mg 2.1 mg/dl, Ca 5.2 mg/dl, creatinine 3.69 mg/dl, normal urine Mg 2.1 mg/dl, Ca 5.2 mg/dl sedimentary blood glucose 36 mg/dl, platelets
Analytical tests were reviewed, which confirmed the presence of hypocalcemia and hyperphosphoremia before at least three years of evolution, with normal renal function, which had gone unnoticed.
The biochemical study of calcemia, acidosis and PTH in parents was normal.
The clinical evolution of the patient was good after the removal of the NSAI, which was attributed to the etiology of acute renal failure, oral and intravenous hydration, oral calcium and vitamin D, with renal function at discharge normal.
Abdominal symptoms subsided after correcting hypocalcemia, without having reported similar episodes again.
