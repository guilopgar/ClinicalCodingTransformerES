A 58-year-old white male patient from urban areas (campesino).
He came to our clinic because of an increase in the volume of the genitals.
The patient had a history of a malignant penile lesion (squamous cell carcinoma) that had been operated 26 years ago, with partial amputation of the penis with bilateral inguinal lymphatic drainage.
A few months later, she began to present progressive increase in genitalia, both in sacs and penis.
Due to the low educational level and the distance from the house to the medical services, coupled with the great lack of prestige, she did not refer to her relatives or even made her unable to attend consultations, living this way for a long time.
