During the newborn period the diagnostic study of HIV infection for children of mothers with HIV infection was carried out according to the Norm of the Public Health Institute of our country.
The study consists in the detection of the viral genome (by PCR) on the first day of life, at 15-30 days of birth and at 3 months of age.
The study was negative for HIV infection, being discharged from the Infectious Diseases Clinic at 18 months of age.
At 2 years and 4 months she presented with fever, intermittent diarrhea and general malaise.
On physical examination an extensive oral cramp and retroauricular lymphadenopathy were found.
Due to the history of being the son of a mother with HIV infection, a positive serology for HIV was requested.
The study of possible transmission mechanisms other than vertical was initiated.
She had no history of transfusions, so the sexual route was considered the most likely.
He was evaluated by a psychologist and psychiatrist, who did not find a sustainable history.
It was also evaluated by two child gynecologists who ruled out signs of sexual abuse.
A rectal endosonography was also performed which was normal, so sexual transmission could not be confirmed.
Reinterrupting the mother and reviewing the recent scientific literature describing prenatal care as a new form of HIV transmission, the mother repeatedly confirmed this practice.
