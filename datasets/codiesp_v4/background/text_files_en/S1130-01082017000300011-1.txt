We report the case of a 47-year-old man diagnosed with bladder adenocarcinoma, treated by Mainz II intestinal diversion.
During posterior fixation, two sessile polypoid lesions were excised, which turned out to be sigmoid granulomas.
Subsequent controls showed ureteral dilation and stenosis of the anastomosis of the left ureter due to the healing of the "polypectomy".
It was decided to perform a combined uro-endoscopic treatment in the operating room and radioguided: through a left nephrostomy, a radio-opaque guide appeared in the stoma stenosis and a sigmoid colon.
An endoscopic balloon dilation of 6 mm Ã˜ was applied over the guide wire without achieving a significant increase in its caliber.
Finally, it was decided to widen the stenosis using a conventional sphincterotome, with which a significant opening of the anastomosis was achieved, proving saline output.
The patient had a poor prognosis.
