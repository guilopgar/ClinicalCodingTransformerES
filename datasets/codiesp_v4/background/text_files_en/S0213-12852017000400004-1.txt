17-year-old patient, single, mestizo, who consulted the Maxillofacial Surgery service of the left size appreciation for symptoms of “increased volume in the left pole” with no signs of maxillary inspection rapidly increasing.
Clinically facial manifestation is observed in left maxillary with erasure of left nasogenian sulcus without inflammatory signs.
Pituitary aperture, a solid mass with well-defined borders that alters the shape of the ipsilateral piriform aperture and produces a bulging of the nasal floor of the left nostril, but maintains its permeability.
In panoramic radiography (Fg.

The presence of the involved tooth is located on the periphery of the lesion.
Histopathological study describes tissue that includes tooth within the tumor.
It shows the presence of a cystic portion delimited by fibroconnective tissue with parallel disposition cells.
There is bone neoformation in the area adjacent to the wall.
In the central area of the cavity, there is a proliferation of cylindrical epithelial cells and some fusocellular cells forming several intercal nodules with bands of hyalinized eosinophilic tissue as a membrane.
There are multiple irregularly marked cell proliferation.
In addition, there are small tubular secretions by cydrical epithelium containing eosinophilic vesicles in the lumen.
