A 63-year-old man with a history of severe pulmonary emphysema and a history of smoking cessation with IPA of 35 was treated with anticholinergics and long-acting beta agonists and pulmonary rehabilitation.
It was referred for evaluation of LV from another center.
Chest X-ray showed pulmonary hyperinstitution, which was confirmed by chest CT, which showed heterogeneous pulmonary emphysema predominantly in both upper lobes with left major fissure of 90%.
Evaluation by VIDA® system on the integrity of the fissures showed 100% left fissure.
This was confirmed by the absence of collateral ventilation with CHARTIS® system.
Baseline pulmonary function parameters showed an FEV1 of 1.13 Lts (48.3% predicted), residual volume of 4.70 Lts (188.1% predicted), St. George's 6MWT of 23 points and 6MWT of 65 points.
Three LV were installed in the left upper lobe without complications after the procedure.
At 6 months of follow-up, there was an increase in 6MWT by 62 mts, an increase in FEV1 to 1.35 Lts (57.7%), with a reduction in residual volume to 3.90 Lts (156%) and a 53 St.
Clinically presenting minimal dyspnea on exercise.
