We report the case of a 67-year-old man who presented with ulcerated polypoid lesions 35 cm from the anal margin.
Biopsy was nonspecific.
CT and virtual colonography showed a polypoid mass in the left colon of 4.5x3.6x3.7 cm with regional lymph nodes, without distant metastases.
The patient came to the emergency department with rectal bleeding and abdominal pain.
Ultrasound showed a colic invagination caused by the polypoid mass.
A midline laparotomy showed an invagination in the descending colon without observing distant dissemination.
A segmental colectomy was performed with mechanical side-to-side anastomosis.
The patient was admitted favorably.
The anatomopathological study reported a well-defined white-yellow submucosal tumor composed of spindle cells that formed palisade, an intratumoral lymphoid infiltrate with peripheral nodules and low mitotic activity.
Immunohistochemistry was positive for S-100 and CD68, with no reactivity for CD117, CD34, actin and CD10.
Definitive diagnosis was colonic colitis.
In 3 years of follow-up there was no evidence of recurrence.
