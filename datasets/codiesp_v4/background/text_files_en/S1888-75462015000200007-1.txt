A 37-year-old male patient with no relevant medical or surgical history was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital, days after ankle torsion, with forced-inversion mechanism during sports training.
In the initial phases, the lesion did not reduce activities of daily living, but 4 days after the accident presented difficulty to walk and Daniela produced a common tibial limb in the foot exploration of the anterior muscles, such as the extensor muscles.
There were no inflammatory signs, ligament laxity or pain related to palpation of muscle-tendinous structures or ligament complexes of the foot and ankle, and no painful symptoms were observed in the malleolus neck.

No pathological findings were found in simple radiology or magnetic resonance imaging.
However, the electromyographic-electroneurographic study (EMG-ENG), performed 4 weeks after the accident, showed an intense involvement of the right common peroneal nerve at the level of the distal epiphysis and showed no neurological alterations.
The patient was treated conservatively with antineurotic and steroid medication intramuscularly.
A carbon fiber orthosis was prescribed from the beginning and subsequent electrostimulation treatment carried out in our rehabilitation service.
The condition resolved 5 months after the lesion was produced, and the patient was discharged without sequelae and returned to his usual work and sports activity.
