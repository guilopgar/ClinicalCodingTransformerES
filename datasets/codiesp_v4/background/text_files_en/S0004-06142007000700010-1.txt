Persistence of voiding symptoms that did not respond to alpha-blockers or antibiotics for urinary tract infection and STD continued to occur. Urethrocystoscopy revealed formations of bladder voiding block.
With a view to making a definitive diagnosis, bladder TUR with coagulation of the lesion was performed under spinal anesthesia prior to taking cold superficial biopsies in the bladder fundus for pathological analysis.
The histological study showed a reactive urothelium to cystic eggs and a thickening of the calcifying membrane wall in partially calcified eggs of a diffuse inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells in addition to granulomas and multinucleated cells.
The finding of these eggs allowed the diagnosis of bladder schistosomiasis in chronic or late phase, establishing treatment with Praziquantel 40mg/kg in monodose.
