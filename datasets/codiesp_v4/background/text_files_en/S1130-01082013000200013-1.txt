We report the case of a 50-year-old man diagnosed with ileal CD in 1978, with long-standing perianal disease (PDA) and difficult to control.
Due to the severity of the APE, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed to determine whether the intra-abdominal adenopatic package is being used.
Exploratory laparotomy was performed with intraoperative biopsy with histology of low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma, and later a wide resection nonperineal cystoprostatectomy radical cystoprostatectomy due to obturator area was not possible either.
A moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the rectum and perineum was observed in the histological specimen, implanted over a deep perineal fistula.
The possibility of radiotherapy has been ruled out and is currently undergoing chemotherapy cycles.
