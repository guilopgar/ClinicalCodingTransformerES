A 5-month-old male patient diagnosed with congenital nystagmus.
The existence of oculocutaneous albinism stands out as a personal history of interest.
At the time of diagnosis, it is not possible to record preferential vision because of a large amplitude pendular horizontal nystagmus that prevents foveal fixation periods.
There is no nystagmus block in any position of gaze or convergence.
Biomicroscopic examination revealed no relevant findings except mild hypopigmentation of the iris with mild degree of transience.
The eye fundus shows moderate hypopigmentation with a physiological aspect of the optic nerve head.
There is no torticollis at the time of diagnosis and the refractive defect found is not significant.
After the diagnosis and the different complementary examinations, an injection of 2.5 IU of botulinum toxin was performed in the horizontal rectus muscles of both eyes. The visual acuity decreased during the first visual acuity cycles but did not increase during the first injection.
No permanent complications were observed in the development of horizontal or vertical strabismus.
