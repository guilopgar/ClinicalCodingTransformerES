The noise coming from a fight in a building alerted the police officers.
When they arrive at home, the police station found a 58-year-old woman who died due to aggression by a relative with a history of psychotic disorder.
At the place of death several objects were found compatible with having provoked aggression: two clicks, one partially with the curved leaf and the other with the broken leaf next to a table holder with two folds of tip.

During the autopsy, multiple white weapon lesions were evident at the cervical and scalp levels, as well as hematomas indicative of defensive-gloving lesions on the back of the right hand.
The cause of death was hypovolemic shock as a consequence of a white weapon wound at the cervical level that completely affected the right carotid artery.
In addition, wounds were found at the level of the right facial mass and homo shoulder grouped in number of two to four wounds, arranged in line, rounded edges and superficial cracks, between them 0.5 cm.
The damaging pattern suggested that these lesions were compatible with having been produced by the table holder found at the scene of death.
Although these lesions were evident in some areas, in the injured areas where the holder had acted in a conscious way and therefore overlapped, they were more difficult to interpret.
