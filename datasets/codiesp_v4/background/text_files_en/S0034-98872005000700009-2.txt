An 11-year-old female patient with a history of chronic cough, asymptomatic up to 8 years of age, presented with recurrent epistaxis.
Due to the fact of having a sister with EvW, a hematological study was performed prior to surgery to remove tonsils, which showed findings consistent with an EvW: TTPA of 42.5 WVR-14 27%.
Before and during surgery, tranexamic acid and cryoprecipitate were indicated, evolving without incidents.
In the following years the patient persisted with repeated epistaxis.
At 10 years of age, a sister with primary hypothyroidism was given an endocrinological study that showed that she also had a primary hypothyroidism due to chronic thyroiditis of unknown origin.
Currently, the patient is being treated with levothyroxine 100 ug/day, since the beginning of hormone replacement therapy has not presented epistaxis again, its aPTT is 35 86% s.
