We report the case of a 14-year-old young man who complained of an old history of penile hypospadias surgery since he was one year old, followed by urethral stricture and Denis Brown ÃÅs urethroplasty. He continued to treat persistent postoperative fistula
We arrive with distal urethral stricture, a sacciform diverticulum of the penile urethra inhabited by small lithiasis that, upon expressing, gives rise to purulent urine.
Given the complexity, it was decided the treatment in several times with initial plane of the entire anterior urethra, posterior urethral reconstruction and burial in scrotum and finally penile release.
Twenty years later, the patient has not had recurrence of the diverticulum.
