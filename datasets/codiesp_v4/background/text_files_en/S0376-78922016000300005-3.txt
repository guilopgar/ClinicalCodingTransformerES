A newborn male patient at 40 weeks of gestation, with no history of interest, who is admitted to our service due to congenital microcystic lymphvicosis of the lungs and lungs due to burns.
1.
At 7 days of life she underwent puncture and evacuation of lymphangioma with subsequent instillation of polidocanol and ethanol.
Treatment was repeated 5 days later.
Of the 7 drains placed, 1 axillary location was removed after 3 days due to apparent skin suffering.
After the second instillation, we observed a superficial wound of 3x10 cm diameter, affecting the region of humilia and a. the anterior surface of the chest, secondary to tip extravasation of the polidocan instillation catheter.
The lesion was treated with cures with hydrocolloid dressings.
One week later, we managed to control the placement of a vacuum therapy system (Renasys速, Smith&Nephew速, London, UK) at 100 mmHg, continuously, with the aim of closing the lymph node
dressing changes were performed every 72 hours and vacuum therapy was used for 21 days.
1.
The wound was hospitalized until 2 months of life and was discharged with domiciliary dressings with Aquacel速 Ag (ConvaTec速, United Kingdom), until achieving total and stable closure of the ambulatory.
At 11 months of age, she presents a persistent mass, mainly due to hypertrophy of the subcutaneous cellular tissue, with residual cystic lesions predominantly microcystic on the medial surface of the arm and chest wall.
Since the patient is asymptomatic, after consulting the family we maintain conservative treatment and assess its evolution with age.
