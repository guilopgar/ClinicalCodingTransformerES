Antrum biopsies reported chronic diffuse non-atrophic, severe active gastritis and Rusell bodies inside, associated with Helicobacter pylori (HP) ++/++ bacilli
Immunohistochemical studies with CD138 demonstrated reactivity in cytoplasmic cells and light chains of immunoglobulins Kappa and Lambda, confirming the diagnosis of RCG.
Treatment was given for PH, with which the patient presented resolution of her symptoms.
Endoscopic and histopathological control was performed nine months later, which showed a marked improvement compared to the previous study.
