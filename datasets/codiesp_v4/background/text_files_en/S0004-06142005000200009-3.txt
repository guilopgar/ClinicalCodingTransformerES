A 69-year-old patient with a PSA at the time of consultation of 22 ng/ml.
The patient had a previous negative sextant biopsy.
An E-MRI was performed which initially showed a nodule located in the prostate base of the left lobe, morphologically suggestive of nodular hyperplasia, but the spectroscopic study showed a metabolic alteration of this choline nodule, with a significant elevation of neoplasia.
