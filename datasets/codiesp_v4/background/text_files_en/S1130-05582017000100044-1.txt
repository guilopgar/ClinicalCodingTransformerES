A 34-year-old male with no relevant personal history.
The patient underwent a pleomorphic adenoma through the cervical-parotid approach with total resection of the tumor and preservation of the facial nerve.
The patient was discharged 4 days after surgery.
The result of the pathological analysis of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma with free surgical margins.
Postoperative follow-up MRI confirmed total tumor resection.
In the first review, two weeks after surgery, the patient complained of severe pain consistent with episodes of lassodic food at the level of the pre-meterin and posterior regions of the left cervical region with the first bite syndrome.

An excellent control of symptoms was achieved after 15 days.
At 10 months, the patient reported the appearance of the same symptoms, so a new seizure was performed achieving again good control of symptoms at 10 days.
