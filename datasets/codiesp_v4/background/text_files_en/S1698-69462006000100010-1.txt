A 60-year-old white woman was referred to the Oral Medicine Service of the School of Dentistry, Federal University of Minas Gerais for the evaluation of asymptomatic lesions in the oral cavity.
Medical history revealed controlled systemic arterial hypertension and varicose veins.
Intraoral examination revealed three bitten nodules.
Two of the lesions were present in the right jugular mucosa adjacent to the oral commissure and measuring approximately 10x10mm in diameter and the other nodule was in the sublingual region with a measurement of approximately 5x5mm.
The patient admitted that the lesions had been present for 20 years.
History and clinical examination led to the diagnosis of mucosal varices, which were treated with 2.5% monoethanolamine oleate (EO).
Treatment consisted of intranasal injection of 1ml to 2.5% LE divided into four or five points.
Intracranial aspiration was confirmed by blood aspiration.
Then the solution was slowly injected, the lesions were obliterated with gauze.
The patient underwent three sclerotherapy sessions for each lesion, with an interval of two weeks.
The lesions disappeared after the third session and no recurrence was observed after 30 months.
