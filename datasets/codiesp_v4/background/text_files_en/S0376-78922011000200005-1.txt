A 41-year-old patient came to the Plastic Surgery Department of Hospital 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain) after suffering a subtotal penectomy for squamous cell carcinoma that did not require penile reconstruction.
After the completion of the relevant clinical history, exploration and photographic documentation for its study, it was decided to delay surgery until at least 6 months after tumor removal to confirm the absence of recurrence of the local disease.
The existence of superficial and deep palm vascular arches was confirmed by the Allen test and the 8Mhz doppler probe examination, which allowed the choice of a radial free flap for vascular reconstruction of the penis.
The day before the intervention, a suprapump cystostomy was performed.
