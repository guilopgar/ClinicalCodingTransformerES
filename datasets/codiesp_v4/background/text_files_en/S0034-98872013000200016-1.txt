A 59-year-old male with a history of smoking cessation for 4 years and history of aspirin allergy characterized by generalized erythema and glottic edema.
The first time it was in 1974 and it was repeated with a single dose again in 1983, which is why aspirin was never again administered again.
She was admitted in November 2010 due to angina.
Coronary angiography showed significant stenosis in the anterior descending artery, and a stent angioplasty was performed in that vessel.
Due to a history of aspirin allergy, clopidogrel and cilostazol were discontinued.
Three weeks after discharge, the patient developed a new episode of chest pain retro-aortic stenosis and the corona-riography showed intra-stent thrombosis.
She was treated with balloon angioplasty, with intravenous tirofiban infusion, achieving good clinical results.
The intervention was carried out according to a protocol for removing aspirin without incidents.
Since then, aspirin and clopidrogel have been maintained.
After 1 year 2 months of follow-up, with good adherence to therapy, she had no adverse effects and remained without angina and no evidence of HAAS.
