Normal clinical presentation, except for the nail lesions described, weight and height in the 50-75 percentile.
The patient was treated with a multivitamin when there was suspicion of dementia, but after two months the lesions remained unchanged.
Nail piquet led us to suspect several diseases such as differential diagnosis (eczema, nail psoriasis, nail liquen planus and alopecia areata), so it was assessed based on pathology report.
The initial diagnosis was contact dermatitis or lesions secondary to atopy.
Allergies, including heavy metals and nickel, were ruled out.
The absence of contact with materials or products that could cause dermatitis located in the nail bed, the absence of atopian lesions at the time of consultation and the persistence of lesions, an analytical study was performed to
The iron metabolism was analyzed, as well as other possible nutritional deficits (zin, 1-25 normal hydroxy-calciferol, vitamins B12 and B6), thyrotropin (TSH4) and thyroxine.
Autoimmunity parameters were also requested in view of the possibility of nail psoriasis, rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies being negative.
