We report the case of a 75-year-old woman with a history of various abdominal surgeries (intestinal cystectomy, hysterectomy and hernia repair) and colon, who was referred to our hospital due to recent changes.
The sigmoid colon segment showed a highly affected and with diverticula that prevented the passage of the terminal sigmoid colon.
No other anomalies were observed.
Given the situation, we perform a nodule with capsule to evaluate the rest of the colon, a segment of the stenotic left colon, scarcely distensible and with diverticula.
No other lesions were observed.
Nevertheless, capsule endoscopy was completed and excreted before the completion of the batteries (< 10 hours).
