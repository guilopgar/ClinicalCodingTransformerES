59 years old who complained of epigastric abdominal pain not associated with dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss or womanesis as the main symptom.
Complementary examinations revealed a gastrinoscopy in which a lesion was found in the distal third of the esophagus, identifying it as probable submucosal origin, when it was covered with a normal mucosa.
The echoendoscopic study of the distal esophagus revealed a lesion of submucosal origin of 15 mm in diameter, hypoechogenic, originating from echocape 2 (muscle of the mucosa) and independent of echocape 4.
Due to its characteristics, this lesion raised as differential diagnoses esophageal leiomyoma or granular cell tumor.
Endoscopic excision of the lesion was decided against other surveillance strategies, which were performed under deep sedation and with complete resection "bloc" with polypectomy loop, without complications.
Histologically, it was a well-defined, non-encapsulated nodular lesion with low cellularity, whose cells showed elongated nuclei without pleomorphism and scarce mitosis and poorly defined cytoplasms and eosinophils.
These cells were arranged in folded bundles.
Immunohistochemical techniques showed positivity for actin and desmin, and staining with S-100 protein was negative.
These facts were diagnostic for esophageal submucosal leiomyoma.
The patient was discharged without complications.
Subsequent reviews reported the disappearance of symptoms.
