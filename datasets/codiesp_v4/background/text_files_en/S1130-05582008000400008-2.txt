A 40-year-old male was admitted with a fracture of left mandibular angle and right mandibular body associated with a long radiolucent lesion.
This was enucleated intraorally as well as the associated dental roots, followed by stabilization of fragments by intermaxillary block using Ivy ligatures.
Histology confirmed the nature of radicular cyst.
