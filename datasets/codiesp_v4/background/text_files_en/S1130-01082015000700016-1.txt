We report the case of an 89-year-old male patient with a history of ulcerative colitis, myelodysplastic syndrome and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
The patient was followed up by the Digestive Medicine Department because of her ulcerative colitis with serial placements, but due to the patient's refusal to undergo routine colonoscopies, follow-up was decided.
The test was carried out in the Department of diagnostic radiology with manual unconditional air through a rectal probe.
During the technique, the radiologist showed bilateral subdiaphragmatic pneumoperitoneum, as well as multiple bubbles in the mesentery, emphysema in the greater omentum and in the middle of the ileal sector.
Two sessile polyps measuring 9 mm and 7 mm were found in the distal descending colon.
The diagnosis was only radiological, since the patient was asymptomatic.
It was decided to enter the General Surgery Service with clinical and analytical monitoring, absolute diet and empirical antibiotic therapy.
A CT scan of the abdomen was repeated 24 hours later, but a slight decrease in free intra-abdominal fluid and pneumoperitoneum were not observed.
Control laboratory tests showed no increase in acute phase reactants and water tolerance was started on the fourth day.
After one week of admission the patient was discharged without presenting intra-abdominal complications.
