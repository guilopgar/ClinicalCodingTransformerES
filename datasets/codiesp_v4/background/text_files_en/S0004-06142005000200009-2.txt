This is a 60-year-old patient with a PSA elevation of 7ng/ml, subsequently 15 ng/ml and 32 ng/ml months later.
The patient had previously undergone 3 sextant, transrectal and ultrasound guided prostatic biopsies.
It was decided to perform an EBRT in this patient prior to the last biopsy and we found a spectroscopic diagnosis suggestive of prostate neoplasia, so the initial suspicion occurred by spectroscopy.
In this patient, endorectal magnetic resonance imaging showed no alteration suggestive of neoplasia from the morphological point of view.
However, when performing spectroscopy of both central zones, a spectroscopic curve of normal appearance was observed on the right side, with a marked elevation of citrate to 2.5 ppm (parts per million of the dark spectrum) and a curved lobe of neoplasia between 3.0 ppm.
