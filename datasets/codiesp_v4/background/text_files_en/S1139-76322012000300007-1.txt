We report the case of a five-year-old girl who complained of pain in the left shoulder and progressive functional impotence of a week of evolution.
No personal history of interest.
At the time of consultation, the patient complained of severe pain of seven days onset, sudden, in the left upper limb and irradiated to the cervical region.
Sometimes he has wakened up at night and partially with usual analgesia.
In addition, two days ago he commented on progressive functional impotence of the affected limb, which incapacitates it in his daily life.
The week before the onset of symptoms, the patient developed upper respiratory tract infection, which resolved with general measures.
The physical examination revealed functional impotence and weakness of the deltoid muscles, serrate, supra- and infaespinatus with hypoesthesia in the deltoid region.
There are no signs of infectious risk (septic arthritis of the shoulder) or early traumatic history (traction-stretching injury).
On admission, a complete blood count was performed with acute phase reactants, which was abnormal.
A simple radiography of the shoulder is also requested, in which there is no evidence of fracture lines or epiphysiolysis or acute infection (increased soft tissue, secondary effusion or metaphyseal cysts).

It was decided to extend the study and perform electromyography (EMG) showing proximal involvement of the nerve trunks (plexoculopathy of left brachial intensity) including suprascapular nerve and Cnotme root, with severe injury.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows signs of distal tendinopathy of the supraspinatus and deltoid region, in addition to nerve involvement, mainly of the axillary or circumflected nerve, C5 branch.
Having established these findings, the patient was diagnosed with Parson-Turner syndrome (PTS) and started antisepsis treatment in rehabilitation with progressive improvement until complete resolution of the clinical picture in the following weeks without sequelae.
