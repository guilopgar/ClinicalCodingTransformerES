A 72-year-old man with contraindications to BCG therapy was administered post-TUR MMC without side effects.
Subsequently, treatment with intravesical gemcitabine was started, which received eight doses with good tolerance, five weekly and three monthly (the sixth week was not administered for prostatitis with positive urinocultiva for Enterococcus faecalis).
