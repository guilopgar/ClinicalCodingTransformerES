A 59-year-old white female patient presented with a slow-growing mass of four years of evolution, located in the left parotid gland.
There were no pathological antecedents of interest and the mass that motivated the consultation was asymptomatic.
The physical examination revealed the presence of a 3.5 cm diameter tumor, which was insensitive to palpation and covered by normal, displaceable skin with respect to deep tissues.
The rest of the cervicodiaphyseal exploration was normal, and no cervical adenomegaly was detected.
Routine chest X-rays and systematic laboratory tests were performed and were free of pathological findings.
The tumor was excised by a salivary appearance extrafacial parotidectomy, which showed a well-defined appearance, a grayish discoloring tissue and a normal circumstantial greyish course.
Histological processing of the surgical specimen was routine, performing sections of 5 mm thick that were stained with hematoxylin-eosin.
The study of these allowed us to verify that the lesion, which was surrounded by an incompletely formed capsule, was constituted by solid masses of epithelial cells closely associated with ducts covered by two layers of cells.
Occasionally, ductal structures showed cystic proliferations whose lights were occupied by sebaceous material and occasional areas of oncocytic metaplasia.
After five years of follow-up, there was no lesion recurrence.
