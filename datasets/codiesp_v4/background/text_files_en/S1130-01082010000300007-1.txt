A 56-year-old male with a diagnosis of retroperitoneal liposarcoma of low grade malignancy and 15 years of evolution was operated in our center on 8 occasions with various recurrences of different aggressive patterns.
In the first intervention in 1990 a grade I liposarcoma was removed.
The patient was admitted to the internal medicine service of another hospital with a respiratory infection clinic.
Physical examination revealed abdominal discomfort with a painless mass in the left hemiabdomen.
As complementary tests, a chest X-ray showed an elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and an analytical test showed a microcytic and hypochromic anemia compatible with a fertigle.
After these examinations it was decided to perform an abdominal computerized tomography where a mass in the left hemiabdomen of 26 x 20 x 13 cm was observed. The mass in the left hemiabdomen was 26 x 13 cm.
The patient was admitted to our surgery service for evaluation of the surgical treatment.
With a diagnosis of recurrent giant liposarcoma, the patient underwent surgery, confirming intraoperatively the presence of a retroperitoneal mass occupying almost the entire left hemiabdomen.
Tumor excision and locoregional invasion were performed.
During the postoperative period, the patient presented with a fever which, after ruling out other causes, was attributed to resection, and was discharged.
The pathology report was a mass of 5.35 kg of weight, classified as liposarcoma with areas of dedifferentiation of degree (lipoma like and high-grade lymph node involvement (sympathogenic mass, malignant fibrosarcoma) tissue.
