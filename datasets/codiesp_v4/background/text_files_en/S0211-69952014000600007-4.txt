A 74-year-old male with a self-locating catheter for three years.
The extrusion of the external cuff was indicated due to a recurrent infection of the exit orifice.
The procedure was performed without incident, but the "catheter" of the catheter extruded was difficult because the catheter leaked appeared strongly attached to the catheter and there was a risk of inducing a perforation.
The irregular remains and dirty of the external cuff were too close to the exit orifice and could favor a new infection, either by irritation at the exit site or by colonization.
For this reason, silicone was removed using a plastic mold.
As there was no breakage, the catheter segment was not necessary in this case and dialysis did not break.
The patient had no infection after the procedure.
