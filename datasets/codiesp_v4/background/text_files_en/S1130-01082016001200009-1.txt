An 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertransaminasemia not studied.
She complained of edema in the lower limbs and abdominal distension with ascites.
Analytically, there was an elevation of stasis enzymes and hypertransaminasemia, with positive antimitochondral antibodies (AMA-M2).
Digestive ultrasound showed chronic liver disease with portal hypertension and ascites.
In addition, he presented a heterogeneous hypoechogenic mass of 56 x 45 mm, dependent on the posterior aspect of the gastric body.
Gastroscopy defined compression and TAC as an extra gastric mass.
No endoscopic ultrasound study was performed due to a poor clinical situation, opting for percutaneous ultrasound guided biopsy of the lesion.
Mesenchymal neoplasm of spindle cells exposed in fascicles, with intense expression of S-100 and negativity for actin, desmin, CD34 and CD117, compatible with the gastric tumor, was reported.
Observation declined the surgical option.
