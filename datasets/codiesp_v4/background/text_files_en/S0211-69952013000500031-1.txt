A 23-year-old male with CRE-V due to polycystic kidney disease.
She received RT from a living donor on June 6, 2011, being the donor group O+ and the receptor group A+, without initial complications with functioning graft at discharge (Crp 1.1 mg/dl). The treatment consisted of tacrolimus 10 g/dl.
Fourteen days after transplantation, laboratory tests were performed and hemoglobin 5.8 g/dl was observed with stable renal function (Crp 1.2 mg/dl) and the rest of the complementary tests (including abdominal CT and ultrasound).
Anemia study showed hemolytic anemia (high compatible haptoglobin, erythrocytes and hemolytic patients) with positive direct Coombs test bilirubin decreased with anti-A antibody in patients treated with anti-PLS.
The patient was treated with transfusions of 4 concentrates of pastes and methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) with subsequent descending order.
Complete resolution without recurrence was observed in the following weeks.
