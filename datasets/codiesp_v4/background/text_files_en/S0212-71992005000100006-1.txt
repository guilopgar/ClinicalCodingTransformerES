A 26-year-old white woman, who had noticed an increase in volume in the left lateral face of the neck for seven years, was studied in another hospital without requiring the diagnosis.
He remained asymptomatic until one year before going to us.
Previously, he had undergone cervical lymph node biopsy and reported benignity of the lesion.
He was admitted to our hospital with an adenomegaly in the left anterolateral region of the neck, 0.5 cm in diameter, of firm consistency, movable and not painful.
The rest of the test was negative.
Laboratory investigations: hemoglobin, hematocrit, leucogram, glycemia, creatinine, transblastic pyruvic transaminase (TGP and GDT), normal prothrombin time (PTT) and partial thrombocyte time (PTT).
Protein electrophoresis: albumin 4.5 g/l; globulins: alpha-1 1.2 g/l, alpha-2 6.6 g/l, beta 11.1 g/l, gamma 25.7 g/l, hepatitis C virus and HTLV B-1, negative
Imaging studies: normal chest plate, abdominal ultrasound and peripheral lymph nodes: tumor mass in the left lateral face of the neck with well-defined contours of 57.6 mm x 23.7 mm in close contact with the left jugular vein.
Medullogram: integrity of the three tumour-free systems.
Bone marrow biopsy: hypercellular marrow with megaloblastic changes and increase in erythrocytes, non-neoplastic.
Liver biopsy showed no abnormalities of pathological significance.
Cervical ganglion biopsy: lymph node with partial blurring of ganglionic architecture and angiofollicular hyperplasia.
Hyperplasia and dysplasia of follicular cells were also observed.
The patient was treated with local radiotherapy after partial excision of the lymph node.
She was also treated with prednisone for five months.
Currently the patient remains asymptomatic.
