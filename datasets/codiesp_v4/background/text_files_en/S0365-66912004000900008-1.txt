A 76-year-old woman was referred by her ophthalmologist with a diagnosis of possible melanoma in the left eye (LE).
The patient was in good health and did not receive systemic or systemic treatment.
Three months ago she complained of left retroocular pain.
He had lost sight of this eye many years earlier, although he could not remember it and its nature.
On examination, the maximum visual acuity in the left eye was amaurosis and in the right eye (OD) 0.20.
A non-calcified, elevated macular mass was observed in the left eye, affecting more than 25% of the uveal tract.
The upper edge of the lesion showed moderate pigment epithelium.
The vitreous showed no cellularity.
The optic nerve was not affected.
Orbital/craneal CT was normal, except for the presence of a small mass in the macula of the left eye.
Ocular ultrasound showed a pattern compatible with choroidal melanoma.
Anatomopathological study: An important thickening of the choroids was observed up to now serrata with a narrow formation measuring 2x1.5 cm with a thickness of 3 mm centered on the macular level.
The lesion described here consists of multiple cleft palates optically empty, elongated, irregular in appearance and formed by cholesterol formed by a foreign body multinucleated giant cell reaction.
Serial sections showed no cholesterol deposits at scleral level.
The pathological diagnosis was extensive choroidal cholesterol granuloma.
