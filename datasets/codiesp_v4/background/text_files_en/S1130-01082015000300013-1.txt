A 69-year-old male with multiple comorbidities (hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alcoholism, hemiparesis due to stroke, smoker), who came to the emergency department of our center because of abdominal discomfort and constipation.
Contrast-enhanced CT showed signs of intestinal obstruction due to parietal lesion in the distal ileum with possible inflammatory-infectious origin.
The persistence of the obstructive clinic was decided urgent intervention, finding moderate ascites of clear appearance (negative cultures: without microorganisms, with few polymorphonuclear leukocytes, a change of 4 cm from an intestinal obstruction high segment.
Resection of this segment and manual termino-terminal anastomosis were performed.
The patient was discharged without complications.
She subsequently did not present other digestive or systemic symptoms during a year of follow-up, with a negative stool test and allergy tests.
The anatomopathological study of the surgical specimen described a segment of intestinal mucosal resection with transmural inflammatory ulcer with predominance of polynuclear eosinophils, which focally grouped eosinophilic abscesses.
These changes are consistent with the diagnosis of EGE.
