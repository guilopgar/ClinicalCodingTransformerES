We present the case of a 12-year-old Spanish male, suffering from abdominal colic pain and flatulence of a month of evolution, accompanied by intermittent diarrhea that interferes with his attendance to school, both for urgency and for pain.
The presence of onychophagia stands out among the antecedents.
Three stool samples were sent to the laboratory of a hospital in the city with negative results.
One month later, due to the persistence of symptoms and weight loss of approximately 4 kg, three other samples were analyzed in the laboratory of another hospital, finding Giardia cysts in this case.
Treatment with metronidazole was performed at a dose of 500 mg every 8 hours for one week, slightly improving abdominal pain and diarrhea but persisting after milk intake.
Lactose was withdrawn from the diet and an unsuccessful introduction was attempted one month later, so another month was withdrawn.
In the following weeks the patient continued with discomfort in the abdomen and soft stools so he resisted to go to school.
At first, psychological conditioners were blamed for this.
But after the symptoms persisted and due to the stagnation, a new coproparasitary study was carried out, being again positive for G.
The asymmetry, biochemistry and iron metabolism parameters were normal.
Another course of treatment with metronidazole was prescribed at the same doses.
Gastrointestinal symptoms disappear and weight regain occurs.
Subsequent coproparasitic studies were negative.
