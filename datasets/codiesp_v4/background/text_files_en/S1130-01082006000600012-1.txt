This is a 69-year-old woman with no known drug allergies, with a history of increased vomiting episodes of gastritis in childhood and treated with proton pump inhibitors, who comes to the emergency room for mild epigastric pain.
The patient complained of colic pain in the hemi-kintur√≥n, and the affiliate patient reported more evident constipation in the last weeks with a last normal deposition at the time of admission.
On physical examination, the abdomen was blushing and depressible, painful to palpation especially in epigastrium, without defense or peritonitis.
Laboratory tests showed 10,100 leukocytes with 77% neutrophils and 15% lymphocytes.
Simple abdominal X-rays showed discontent of small intestines, predominantly centroabdominal with levels in bipedalism, radiological pattern suggestive of mechanical occlusion.
In order to rule out cecoascending tumor pathology, an opaque enema was performed, which showed the absence of colonic pathology.
Incompetence of the ileocecal valve allowed opacification of the pelvic ileum in which a persistent oval filling defect with an invagination component suggestive of tumor pathology was observed.
Laparotomy revealed an invaginated tumor that was resected close to 20 cm of small intestine and a termino-terminal anastomosis was performed.
The patient was discharged one week after surgery.
The pathological study of the surgical specimen identified an inflammatory fibroid polyp (IFP) of 3 cm in diameter occupying the entire lumen of the resected intestinal segment.
