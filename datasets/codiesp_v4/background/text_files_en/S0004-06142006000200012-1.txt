A 51-year-old patient diagnosed 20 years before Neurolues, with established sequelae such as visual and verbal disorders, as well as multiple radiculoneuropathy.
Chest X-ray showed aortic elongation with no clinical impact.
Electroencephalogram was performed with normal tracings, and in the cranial CT with and without contrast showed brain morphology within normal limits.
Lues serology in RPR and TPHA tests were positive.
Folic acid and vitamin B12 were within the normal range.
The patient was referred to our Urodynamics Department for voiding disorders complaining of urge incontinence, not requiring abdominal press for bladder catheterization.
An urodynamic study was performed with the objective of showing a hyperlexic detrusor with high pressures and countervoluntary alterations that did not cause leakage; the pressure/flow curve was not normal.
With the diagnosis of hyperactive detrusor of neurogenic cause, treatment with anticholinergics was started, being currently clinically stable with occasional urgency without incontinence.
