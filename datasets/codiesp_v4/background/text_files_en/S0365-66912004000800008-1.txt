A 3-year-old woman presented with a lesion in the upper eyelid of the right eye, surrounded by a large perilesional edema.
She was initially diagnosed with chalation.
After resolution of the edema, multiple non-pruritic papules measuring 2-5 mm in size occupying almost the entire upper eyelid were discovered.
The lesions were mobile, painless cords that did not interfere with the closure of the eyelid.
Visual acuity was 1 with E Snellen in both eyes.
The rest of the ocular and general examination was normal.
Blood tests, including cholesterol and glucose, showed no change.
A month later, new plaques appeared in the form of an amphibious rim on the thumb and index of the right hand.
A biopsy was then performed in saccades of thumb lesions with local anesthesia.
The anatomopathological result described the sample as an inflammatory infiltrate composed of palisades of histiocytes and lymphocytes surrounding a degenerated collagen area compatible with GA.
With this diagnosis a topical treatment was established in the eyelid with prednisone-neomycin ointment and in the hand with topical nocturnal corticosteroids.
Reviews performed one month and three months later showed, on the one hand, a progressive decrease in the appearance of vesicular lesions, and on the other hand, new lesions with the former.
All of them continued to present remission and, 6 months after diagnosis, only residual lesions could be detected previously.
