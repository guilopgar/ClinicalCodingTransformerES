During the anthropological study of the bone remains of a 31-year-old man, two orifices were found in the sternum.

One of them, located at the level of the second sternum, presented irregular edges and fracture lines.
It is a hole made by a firearm projectile.
The other, located at the level of the third sternum corresponds to a foramen tape.
