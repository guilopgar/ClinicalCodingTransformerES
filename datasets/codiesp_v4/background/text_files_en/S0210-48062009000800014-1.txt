A 55-year-old woman presented with right flank discomfort.
The initial imaging studies (ultrasound and computed tomography) showed a cystic lesion of 10 x 9.5 cm in diameter, with punctiform calcifications in its wall, in close relationship with the right adrenal gland.
In the basal magnetic resonance and contrast study, some solid areas of different thickness were observed in the wall, which grew into the cyst and enhanced with contrast, findings that made us think of a cystic pheochromocytoma.
The usual laboratory and endocrine determinations were normal.
A transperitoneal laparoscopic exeresis was performed using three subcostal accesses, removing the cyst completely, followed by embolization and intracostal aspiration of the cyst using an extra-abdominal approach with a 12-mm sealant, which minimized the wounds.
1.
The macroscopic and histopathological study showed a benign cavitated lesion, dependent on the adrenal cortex, with a dense fibrous wall in which there were remnants of adrenal, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates and calcifying hemorrhagic cyst foci.
The cyst content culture was negative.
