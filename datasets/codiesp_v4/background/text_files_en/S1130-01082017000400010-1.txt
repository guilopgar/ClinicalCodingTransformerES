We report the case of a 57-year-old woman operated on for colon adenocarcinoma, with recurrence in the form of peritoneal carcinomatosis, treated with chemotherapy and surgery, using a biological mesh of PermacolTM for closing the abdominal wall.
In 2015, the patient presented a new rectal-vesical fundus recurrence with rectum, bladder and vaginal vault, so pelvic exenteration was performed with vaginal reconstruction and Bricker type urinary diversion.
Postoperatively, an ileal loop urinary fistula secondary to mesh decubitus was observed.
An endoscopy of the Bricker loop showed a fistulous orifice with a white deposit a 7 cm ileostomy corresponding to the mesh, occupying 50% of the circumference.
Endoscopic placement of a covered metallic prosthesis (HanarostentÂ® Colon/Rectum) of 100 mm x 20 mm was decided, which was removed without incidents after 12 weeks, with resolution of the fistula.
The permanence of the prosthesis was longer than recommended, given our experience and the size of the fistula.
Despite the possibility of recurrence due to persistent mesh, the patient remains without recurrence, probably due to formation of perifistula fibrous tissue.
