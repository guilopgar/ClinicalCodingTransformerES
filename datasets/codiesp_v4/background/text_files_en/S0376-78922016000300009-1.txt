A 78-year-old male patient underwent resection of the right nasal wing due to basal cell carcinoma that had infiltrated its full thickness.
After knowing the result of the frozen section biopsy, a frontal narrow base flap was performed to obtain a narrow base that was folded distally, with the objective of placing the mucosal lining of the vestibule towards the external surface;
After 3 weeks, the flap was lifted and the part of the flap was separated into the nasal vestibule leaving it in situ; then the flap was disgrassed ipsilaterally to the distal neck.
Three weeks later she became self-conscious.
