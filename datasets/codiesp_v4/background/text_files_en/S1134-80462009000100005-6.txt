A 43-year-old female patient diagnosed with cerebral vascular stenosis with severe headache was treated with Durogesic® 25 μg/h for 2 years, with good efficacy and safety.
It is changed to generic fentanyl by a primary care physician, with worsening of pain and withdrawal syndrome with general malaise and dizziness.
The patient was again switched to Durogesic® and again analgesia and withdrawal syndrome disappeared.
