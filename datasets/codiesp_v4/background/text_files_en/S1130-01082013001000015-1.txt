We report a case of malignant melanoma (MM) in a 29-year-old male with ileocolic Crohn's disease (CD) of 18 years of evolution, operated by subtotal colectomy and subsequent severe ileorectal anastomosis due to enterorrhagia.
After surgery (10 years ago) and due to recurrence of difficult-to-control disease, treatment with azathioprine (which had been using for 10 years) and infliximab for 2 years is required.
After loss of response to this, adalimumab was required, which has received since 2008 and needs to be intensified in the last year due to loss of efficacy.
She came to the dermatology department due to facial palsy on her back, which had experienced changes and bleeding from the friction rub of clothes over the past 8 months.
Given the suggestive malignancy, the lesion was removed and identified as a 7 mm ulcerated nodular melanoma (Breslow thickness 1.26 mm and Clark level III) without vascular and/or neural invasion stage TNM2.
A negative sentinel node biopsy was performed.
