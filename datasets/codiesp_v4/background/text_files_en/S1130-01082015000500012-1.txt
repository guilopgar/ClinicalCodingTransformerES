A 58-year-old man with no relevant pathological history presented with progressive esophageal dysphagia for 3 months.
Two years before she had had an episode of food impaction.
Barium-enhanced gastroduodenal radiological study (DGE) detected in the lower esophageal third a saccular image with a well-defined 9 cm diameter air-fluid level.
CT scan confirmed the findings described in the EGD.
Gastroscopy showed a large double lumen image with semisolid food content inside.
