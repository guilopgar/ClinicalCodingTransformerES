A 60-year-old woman with Child-B Alcohol Liver Cirrhosis diagnosed in 2004 with variceal linked esophageal varices.
She was admitted to our hospital in 2009 due to orientation, dyspnea and asthenia, severe anemia with hemoglobin of 4.2 g/dL.
A first upper endoscopy (UED) showed a watermelon stomach VAS managed with APC and platelet, plasma and red blood cell transfusions in an intermediate care unit.
Two months later dyspnea resumed, so a new ADD was performed, confirming the VAS, performing a new CPA session.
At 3, 5 and 6 months of age, the patient presented three other episodes of nausea and vomiting requiring transfusions and ADD, always bleeding VAS, which led to three more APC sessions.
From the last hospitalization, the patient was discharged by scheduling an outpatient endoscopic control in which a stomach with fresh blood and EVA were found, performing endoscopic ligation with 8 bands.
A month later a new ADD showed a clear reduction in the appearance of watermelon stoma, performing new ligatures to the antrum.
