A 69-year-old male underwent nasal tip resection for basal cell carcinoma.
After knowing the result of the frozen section biopsy, the defect was rectified with a frontal lobe for dementia with a narrow base.
After 3 weeks, the flap was self-administered.
Four months later, the patient did not respond to treatment, obtaining excellent results 6 months after the procedure.
