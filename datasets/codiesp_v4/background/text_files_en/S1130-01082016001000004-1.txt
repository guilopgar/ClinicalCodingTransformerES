A 6-year-old girl presented with severe colitis and gastritis after caustic ingestion (industrial dishwashers).
In one month he presented a severe esophageal stenosis with punctiform perforation due to the dilatation that was managed conservatively.
Four months after ingestion, esophageal and antral dilations were restarted due to punctiform stenosis, with attempts to resolve the gastric stenosis after 6 dilatations, but esophageal stenosis persisted after 9 dilatations.
Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was performed.
Ten months after ingestion, a 16 mm diameter x 6 cm long (measurable) ELLA prosthesis was placed.
There were no technical problems in the placement of the prosthesis.
During follow-up, the patient developed chest pain during the first 4 months, which improved with increasing doses of proton pump inhibitors and analgesics.
There was also stenosis due to growth of proximal hyperplastic tissue, which was dissected three times and resolved completely.
Distal stricture relapsed at 4 months (time that delayed stent placement) requiring a new delay.
Nine months after placement of the prosthesis mitomycin was placed in two sessions, being very effective, since after 18 months it remains with solid oral intake and without evident stenosis in gastroscopy.
Currently, mitomycin C has increased the interdilation period from 3-4 weeks to 24 weeks.
