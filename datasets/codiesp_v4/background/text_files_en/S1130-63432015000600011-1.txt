A 51-year-old smoker without known drug allergies, with a history of irritable colon, depressive syndrome and migraines, was diagnosed with a cervical carcinoma apparently located in July 2012.
Hysterectomy, double annexectomy and retroperitoneal surgical lymph node staging were performed.
Final staging showed a pT3N1 (pelvic lymph nodes).
Then he received cisplatin (40 mg/m2 weekly) concomitantly with radiotherapy.
Due to the high probability of relapse, the patient subsequently received chemotherapy with platinum scheme (5 mg/AUC) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2), receiving five cycles in total with several dose reductions with different toxicities (pla).
He remained disease-free until October 2014, when disease progression in the form of peritoneal implants and splenic metastatic implants was detected.
Chemotherapy was started with cisplatin chemotherapy (15 mg/kg), paclitaxel (50 mg/m2) and cisplatin (175 mg/m2) every 21 days.
The day after the first administration the patient came to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain and nausea without vomiting, without fever.
The physical examination detected painful abdomen due to palpation, disseminated both superficially and deeply, with signs of peritonitis.
Imaging tests showed perforation of peritoneal implant at the sigma level, with presence of air bubbles in the upper and lower hemiabdomen, and signs of fecal peritonitis.
Emergency surgery (sigmoidectomy and blindness) was performed.
