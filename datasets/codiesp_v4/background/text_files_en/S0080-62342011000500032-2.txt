A 67-year-old woman was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure and sepsis.
The evolution of the patient was favorable, presenting her situation of shock, but complicated the removal of the mechanical ventilation presented a prolonged weaning, performing a laparotomy for this reason and prologizing her stay in the unit.
50 days after admission to the unit, there are erosive-ulcerous lesions in the interglottic region, which complicates persistent diarrhea that hinders the healing of wounds and healing of wounds.
Therefore, it was decided to insert the Flexi-Seal FMS device, both to prevent the progression of the lesions and to derive the feces to a closed collection system.
It is kept in place for four days without any incidence, and finally removed after a positive evolution of the diarrhea
After a period in which the patient's general condition improves, her clinical situation deteriorates again, and diarrhea reappears, again inserting a Flexi-seal FMS without any incidence.
After 72 hours with the device placed, the patient had a rectal bleeding episode.
If the Flexi-seal FMS is suspected, the device is removed again.
An emergency catheter is placed in order to identify a posterior rectal ulcer of ischemic origin caused by Flexi-seal FMS as the cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding.
Persistence of bleeding and diarrhea with deterioration of the general situation of the patient was made a second attempt confirming the previous diagnosis.
