A 75-year-old male patient with a history of cardiomyopathy treated with contraceptives and amiodarone.
He has lived for 16 years with a dog at home.
The outpatient setting is characterized by significant urinary tenesmus, with great voiding difficulty, requiring permanent catheter.
In turn, he reported difficulty to defecate in recent months, without response to various treatments.
Physical examination revealed painful abdomen due to palpation of the right flank and iliac fossa, where a large fixed mass was intuited in these regions.
There is no evidence of abdominal defense or signs of peritonitis.
The rectal examination indicates a fibroadenomatous prostate grade II/IV, not suspicious for malignancy.
Abdominal radiography showed a mass effect located in the pelvis and right lower hemiabdomen.
Abdominal ultrasound revealed a cystic pelvic mass, which was later confirmed by computed tomography (CT).
This describes a large, encapsulated, 15 cm pelvic mass with several cystic formations inside, compressing the vesicoprostatic region, which may be compatible with a pelvic cyst.
In the liver, a cystic mass partially calcified in segment IV is observed, of approximately 5 cm in diameter, which could correspond to a hepatic hydatid cyst.
1.
These findings were treated withbendazole for two cycles of 28 days each.
Subsequently, the patient was scheduled for surgery, and the pelvic hydatid cyst was partially removed.
The postoperative course was uneventful.
Months later, the cyst was scheduled for surgery in the left hepatic lobe and marsupialization was performed.
Serial CT scans were performed 5 years after surgery, all of them with no findings of interest; only a calcified lesion was observed in the hepatic segment IV, presumably residual to the hydatid cyst.
From the urological point of view, asymptomatic until now.
