We present a 77-year-old male smoker 50 packs/year, with COPD and atrial fibrillation.
He came to the emergency department with progressive dysphagia for solids of three months of evolution and in the last month to liquids together with anorexia and weight loss.
Endoscopy detects an exophytic neoformation in the middle third of the esophagus of six centimeters that causes partial stenosis of the light.
The scan showed an esophageal tumor without local or distant extension.
Bronchoscopy was negative for malignancy ruling out invasion of the respiratory tree.
The microscopic study showed a proliferation of mesenchymal spindle cells arranged in bundles, with increased vascularization and high mitotic index together with abundant necrosis.
Immunohistochemical analysis is negative for desmin, S-100 protein, c-kit and cytokeratin C117 as well as for cytokeratins AE1/AE3, CAM5, 2 and 5/6.
Therefore, we concluded that our patient had a malignant mesenchymal tumor compatible with poorly differentiated sarcoma.
He was evaluated for surgical and oncological treatment, dismissing them for deterioration of his general condition, with placement of an endoprosthesis.
