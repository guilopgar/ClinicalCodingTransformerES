A 70-year-old woman diagnosed with dyscal hernia and spondylolisthesis was treated with Durogesic® 75 μg/h for 4 years, with good efficacy and safety.
It is changed in the pharmacy by generic fentanyl, and there is a worsening of the pain.
The patient was again switched to Durogesic® and analgesia was again administered.
