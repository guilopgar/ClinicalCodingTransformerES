A 45-year-old male, chronic active drinker, diagnosed with liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension, who was being studied for recurrent syncope.
During the diagnostic process, a chest x-ray was performed on an anterior chest x-ray (AP), which showed a lateral displacement of the pleuro-azygo-esophageal line and a left paraspinal midline compatible with a thick.
With the suspicion of a mass of vascular origin, a multislice computed tomography (CT) was performed, identifying an occupation of the posterior mediastinum by vascular structures that caused a lateral displacement of the esophagus.
This mass did not present enhancement in the arterial phase, contrasting during the venous phase, so it was compatible with the diagnosis of giant mediastinal varices.
