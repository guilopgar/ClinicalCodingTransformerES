A 44-year-old male presented to the emergency department with blurred vision in his right eye (OD).
The patient had been reviewed in our service in 1990, 14 years ago, for presenting a first episode blurred vision.
Visual acuity (VA) was 9/10 in RE and OI unit.
Location without findings, except in the eye fundus (FO) showed exudates, and mild exudates in the peripapillary and temporal regions.
Coats' disease was a suspected diagnosis, despite the presentation unilateral adult subject, funduscopic appearance, angiography (AGF) and absence of personal history related to exudates.
The general study (blood analysis, serology and chest X-ray) showed no abnormalities.
Argon laser photocoagulation was performed in 3 sessions.
The exudates were completely reabsorbed in a year and a half, maintaining VA of the unit and leaving only the laser scar.
