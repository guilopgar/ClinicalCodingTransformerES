During the month of September 2011 in the village of Ser√≤s (Lleida) a double burial was observed in simple fossa corresponding to simultaneous primary smoking of two individuals.
The skeletons were articulated in a supine position, one of them partially above the other.
The position of the remnants was followed by irregularity of the fossa, with the pelvic girdle and ribs at a lower level, while the upper and lower limbs of both individuals were slightly higher than the rest of the body.
The ballistic material associated with bone remains, as well as the characteristics of smoking allowed the orientation of the military context of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939).

The anthropological study of the remains indicated that these skeletons belonged to two males between 22-25 and 25-29 years old1.
In both cases perimortal lesions were observed by firearm projectile as cause of death.
The oldest individual presented cranial lesions consisting of an entrance hole in the right occipital condyle (with a minimum diameter of 10 mm) and an exit orifice in the right parietal bone 2.

During the examination of the rest of the skeleton in the laboratory, a L5 lesion was found.
Macroscopically and radiologically, a destructive focus was observed on the anterosuperior border of the fifth lumbar vertebra corresponding to the classic sign of Pedro Pons, compatible with brucellar spondylitis.
Sacroiliac involvement was not observed.
The presence of Pedro Pons' sign indicates that this individual suffered brucellosis for at least three weeks before his death.
