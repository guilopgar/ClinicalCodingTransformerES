Livedoid vasculitis is a chronic condition characterized by a recessive disorder of the microstructure.
The clinical manifestation is a triad consisting of a reticulated distribution of maculae and purpuric papules, painful episodic ulcers and healing with white atrophic scar known as white atrophic scar.
There are 2 types: idiopathic and secondary (connective tissue disease).
It is frequently associated with altered coagulation and markers such as platelet activation and a state of primary or secondary hypercoagulability can be found26.
Histopathology shows capillary vessels occluded by focal fibrin thrombosis and vessel wall degeneration.
Unlike primary vasculitis, there is minimal perivascular infiltrate.
Treatment includes platelet aggregation and systemic anticoagulation, preferably low molecular weight heparin26.
