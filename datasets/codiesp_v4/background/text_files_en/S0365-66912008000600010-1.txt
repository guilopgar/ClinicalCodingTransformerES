A 28-year-old woman with a history of multiple white evanescent lesions in both eyes for 7 years and good response to oral corticosteroid therapy.
He came to the emergency room of our hospital due to decreased bilateral visual acuity and headache of 15 days of evolution.
The exploration revealed a visual acuity of 3/10 with anterior chamber inflammatory reaction and bilateral exudative retinal detachment.
Oral corticosteroid treatment was initiated at high doses of prednisone, with a good initial response.
One month after treatment there is a recurrence of foveal retinal detachment in the left eye, so it is associated with CyA treatment (initial dose of 4 mg/kg/day).
After nine months of follow-up, she had a visual acuity of unity in the right eye and 8/10 in the left eye with pigmentary mobilization in four quadrants and subretinal fibrosis.
