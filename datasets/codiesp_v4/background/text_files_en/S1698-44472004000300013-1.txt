A 41-year-old woman presented to our clinic with a slow-growing, non-painful tumor in the last six months at the upper jaw, between the 14 and 15 premolars, which remained vital, displacing their roots slightly.
There is no pain, no trophic changes or signs of inflammation.
The examination showed an expansion in the vestibular cortex, with its integrity.
Radiography showed a radiolucent image between the roots of the upper premolars.

The histopathological study gave us the diagnosis of OKC with isolated corneal microinclusions in the cystic wall that offers an isolated cartilaginous component; cellular proliferation amel is not observed.
