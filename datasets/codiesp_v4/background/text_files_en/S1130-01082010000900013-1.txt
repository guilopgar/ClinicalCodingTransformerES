A 46-year-old woman presented with recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss.
He was born in Ecuador but had lived in Spain for nine years, currently in Murcia.
She had a history of intestinal resection surgery performed in her country and colitis pending intervention.
She reported a 4-month history of epigastric and periumbilical pain radiating to the right hypochondrium and vomiting after ingestion, in addition to abundant greenish stools that did not respect the night weight, without pathological products.
On physical examination, emphasis is placed on skin and mucous membrane tenderness, dyspnoea, abdominal pain and diffuse constipation.
Laboratory tests showed microcytic anemia (hemoglobin 7 g/dl, MCV 67 nm), normal total leukocytes but with a slight increase in eosinophils and an increase in acute phase reactants.
Abdominal X-ray was compatible with intestinal subocclusion due to the presence of abundant air-fluid levels.
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed ododuodenitis. Biopsies were taken and reported as nonspecific inflammation without bulbil signs and erosive gastritis.
In the small intestine the loss of connivative valves is negative at the duodenum and transitional levels and other signs suggestive of malabsorption in blood are suggestive of dysxylosis.
First-phase larvae or rhabditiformes of stercolaris were observed in one of the stool samples sent to microbiology.
The infection was treated with topical salicylic acid (6 g daily) for two consecutive days. The patient was asymptomatic and her stool samples were not visualized after the end of treatment.
