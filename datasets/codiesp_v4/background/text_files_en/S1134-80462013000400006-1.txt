An 11-year-old girl with CRPS of the right lower limb secondary to an ankle sprain occurred one year before arrival at the Unit.
Placing in the operating room under general anesthesia of an octopolar electrode (Octrode) from the firm ANS (Advances Neurological Systems Inc, Plan.
USA) between T8-T12 and connection to an external electrical impulse generator.
After cleaning the patient, the system was programmed to locate the paresthesias on the affected area.
The patient was revised two weeks later with a good response generator of both pain and other accompanying symptoms, so it was decided to place a programmable pulse in the operating room under general anesthesia.
A week, 15 and 30 days after the implantation of the generator was reviewed, observing that he had started rehabilitation exercises that he could not do before due to the intense pain and allodynia of his ankle and foot doing his normal life first.
Ten months after the implantation of the generator, in the review carried out in the unit, we found that both pain and joint edema were reappearing for a week.
It was found that the implantable battery was exhaust generator due to the continuous functioning that had been necessary to do to keep the patient's symptoms controlled, in this situation it was decided to implant a new generator time, EON brand.
This new generator was also implanted in the operating room under general anesthesia.
The child has returned to school with control of both pain and other symptoms, currently fully asymptomatic.
