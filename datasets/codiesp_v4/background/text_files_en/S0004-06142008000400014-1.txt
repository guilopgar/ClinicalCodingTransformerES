CASE 1: 59-year-old patient who attended urology consultation due to an increase in size of the right eye and without a history of trauma.
In the imaging study (NMR), a well-defined focal spherical lesion is described on the right side of a localized fibrous wall, hypointense, and multiple septa in the right side cystic lesion, although irregular, cm.
1.
With the diagnosis of probable septate cyst of the head of the epididymis, surgical intervention is performed, performing complete excision of the lesion via transmissesis.
Macroscopically, it is a nodular, elastic surface and brownish coloration formation.
At the cut, a multicystic cavity is observed, delimited by a thick capsule with a fibrous appearance, with multiple septa of diverse thickness and occupied by a material with a helium aspect.
The microscopic study confirms the hematic nature of the content and the fibrous component of the walls and septa in the capsule calcifying images and cholesterol granulomas.
1.
CASE 2: 82-year-old patient with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypertensive ischemic heart disease, advanced COPD, hyperuricemia and hypercholesterinemia, who consulted for a right testicular mass with negative markers for one month.
In the imaging study, ultrasound, an intratesticular mass with numerous septa is described, displacing the testicular parenchyma, approximately 5 cm in diameter.
1.
With the diagnosis of right intratesticular mass, surgical intervention is performed with radical orchiectomy.
The macroscopic study of the specimen describes a cystic lesion, multilocular, occupied by mucinous material, which reaches a maximum diameter of 6 cm, and which displaces and compresses adjacent testicular parenchyma.
1.
In the microscopic study the lesion consists of a thick fibrous capsule with fibrous septa accompanied by chronic inflammatory infiltrate, with cholesterol granulomas, and abundant hemosiderin deposit.
