A seven-year-old girl of ethiope origin was referred to our service due to the presence of multiple dark spots in the tongue.
The child's personal and family history was unknown when it was adopted.
On examination we observed numerous points of brown pigmentation in the tongue, predominantly in the tip and back.
With the dermal matrix, we observed that the pigmentation exclusively affected fungiform papillae, which acquired an aspect in "pink petal"2.
We did not see hyperpigmented macules in the rest of the oral cavity, nails or perianal region.
