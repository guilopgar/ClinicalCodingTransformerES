A 13-year-old boy was seen at the bronchopulmonary polyclinic with a history of frequent obstructive bronchial symptoms and recurrent respiratory infections, with good response to conventional treatment.
Due to chest pain, a CT scan of the chest revealed an image in the right upper lobe consistent with intralobar PS.
Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were normal.
A hemodynamic study was performed using sedation and local anesthesia with lidocaine. The right femoral artery was catheterized with 5 French.
Thoracic lobule diameter was determined using a 5 French Pig catheter, where a 6mm maximum diameter right arcuate originating from the thoracic aorta and directed to the upper lung was researched.

A 5 French multipurpose catheter was used to cannulate the catheter. Subsequently, a control catheter of its location was replaced with a control catheter of its 6-dimensional multipurpose. After this, a long-lasting catheter was placed, using an implant-supported matrix.
The patient was discharged the following day without complications and was controlled with chest X-ray in which an in situ device and free lung fields were evidenced.
The patient was monitored at one week, month, six months, one year and two years later. All controls were asymptomatic and in excellent condition.
