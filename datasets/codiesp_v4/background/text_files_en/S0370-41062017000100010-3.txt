A 6-month-old male patient, vaccinated up to 4 months, with fever and labial lesions of 24 h duration.
The patient had a blood count of 5200 leukocytes per mm3 (1% segmented), severe neutropenia, CRP 227 mg/l, procalcitonin 77 ug/ml, and culture of lip lesions (+) to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Treatment was initiated with ceftazidime, amikacin and cloxacillin.
The levels of immunoglobulins IgG, IgA and IgM are decreased, receiving GGEV 400 mg/kg. Normalization of neutrophils at 48 h.
Lymphocyte subpopulations with absence of B lymphocytes, suggestive of agammaglobulinemia.
A history of maternal uncle with agammaglobulinemia appears and is linked to X chromosome. The evolution is favorable, reversing sepsis.
It requires monthly administration of GGEV.
You have not had infections again.
