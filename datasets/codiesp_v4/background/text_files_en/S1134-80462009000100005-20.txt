The patient was a 70-year-old woman weighing 62 kg.
She was diagnosed with lumbar spondyloarthrosis with radiculopathy and treated with Durogesic® Matrix 50 μg/h, paracetamol 1 g, occasionally, and pregabalin 75 mg/12 h for 4 months.
She came to the clinic for poor analgesic control for 2 weeks, under treatment with generic fentanyl 100 μg/h (VAS, 8).
Durogesic® 50 μg/h is prescribed again and initial treatment is maintained, being evaluated at 15 days, where there is evidence of clinical improvement (VAS, 4).
