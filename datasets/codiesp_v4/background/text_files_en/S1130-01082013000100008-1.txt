A 67-year-old male with embolic liver cirrhosis and no cardiopulmonary history was admitted for hepatic encephalopathy secondary to constipation.
A chest X-ray showed a rounded radiopaque lesion with regular margins in the left hemithorax that did not exist in previous controls. Empirical antibiotic treatment was started when pneumonia was suspected.
On chest CT, the collection was smooth and regular edges with water density content, suggesting the possibility of loculated intrathoracic ascites.
The patient rapidly improved his symptoms, but at discharge the previously described lesion persisted, which disappeared after one month with diuretic therapy.
