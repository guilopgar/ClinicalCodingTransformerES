A 27-year-old female smoker was admitted to our hospital with a 1-month and a half-year history of sudden, non-painful, slow onset left cervical tumor.
He did not report fever, dysphonia or odynophagia.
Physical examination showed a mobile left laterocervical adenopathy of 5 x 5 x 4cm, non-painful, well-defined, although adhered to superficial muscular plane and fascia.
The rest of the general examination and ENT showed no other abnormalities.
Complementary tests with systematic blood, ESR, peripheral blood extension, biochemistry, proteinogram and immunoglobulins were normal.
TSH, C3, C4, CRP and tumor markers values were within normal range.
Mantoux was negative.
The serological study showed IgG class Ac for toxoplasma, cytomegalovirus and Epstein&#146;s anomaly Ac class IgM negative for all of them, as well as Ac against HIV negative.
The chest X-ray was normal.
Cervical ultrasound showed a solid, highly vascularized nodule measuring 3.5 cm, located below the ligamentummastoid muscle, with a smooth edge slightly undulating and well defined with heterogeneous echogenicity with linear septa.
Around it, numerous solid ovoid nodules, larger than 2 cm non-vascularized, consistent with lymphadenopathy.
The parotid and submandibular glands were normal.
Cervical/thoracic/abdominal CT scan showed a solid nodule of approximately 4cm in diameter larger, in the left laterocervical chain, hyperdense after contrast injection with small thoracic lymphadenopathy 1 cm smaller satellite abdomen.
FNAC was performed under CT control that showed nonspecific reactive lymphadenitis, so we proceeded to the removal of the larger adenopathy, whose pathological anatomy showed hyaline vascular angiolymphoid hyperplasia of the histological type.
One year after surgery, the patient is asymptomatic at follow-up, with complementary tests of blood analysis, proteinogram, immunoglobulins and normal radiological control study.
