A 52-year-old patient complained of pain in the left hemiscrotum of several days of evolution, with no other accompanying symptoms.
On physical examination, the patient had a left test slightly decreased in size, with an induration in the upper pole, painful to the touch.
Tumor markers (b-hCG and a-FP) were normal.
The ultrasound study showed the presence of a left intratesticular hypoechogenic nodular lesion of 13.2 x 12.6 mm, with slightly irregular borders, which showed no flow in the color Doppler analysis.
With the diagnosis of left testicular tumor inguinal orchiectomy was performed.
Macroscopically, the orchiectomy specimen showed a tunica albuginea without prominent nodules, although an induration was observed in the upper pole of the testicle.
At the cut, this induration corresponded to a well-defined hemorrhagic nodule of 1.7 cm in diameter, which contacted the albuginea without erosion.
Histopathologically, the nodule corresponded to a segmental testicular infarction, with no evidence of malignancy or signs of vasculitis.
