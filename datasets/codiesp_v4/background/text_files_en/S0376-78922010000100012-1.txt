We report the case of a 39-year-old male patient, with areas of biparietal exposure, areas of integrated dermal graft and consolidation tissue, treated with 5 months of evolution after resection of squamous cell carcinoma
1.
According to the local characteristics of the defect and its location, we consider covering the bone defect by means of a free microvascularised skin flap occipital skin, due to local expansions in the face of tissue flaps that are not easily accessible.
Scheme 1: Design of the preconditioned occipital flap anastomosed to the superficial temporal vessels.
