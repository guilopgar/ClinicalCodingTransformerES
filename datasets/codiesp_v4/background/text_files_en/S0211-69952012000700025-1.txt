We report the case of a 46-year-old patient with chronic renal failure, on quarterly hemodialysis for 23 years, secondary to obstructive uropathy, with a left femoral loop of 21 months of use that caused venous edema with a pseudoaneurysm.
One of these pseudoaneurysms had active bleeding.
The three pseudoaneurysms and occlusion of the left iliac vein were treated endovascularly under local anesthesia.
The pseudoaneurysm that had active bleeding was assisted with a covered stent and the remaining two were embolized percutaneously by injecting balloon-assisted thrombin to avoid stent thrombosis.
The iliac venous axis was recanalized and treated with angioplasty balloons. In the final angiographic controls, the absence of pseudoaneurysms was observed, with patency of the prosthesis and the iliac venous drainage with disappearance of complications.
