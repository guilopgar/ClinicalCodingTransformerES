A 12-year-old girl, sitting without a seat belt in the back of a car, suffered a car accident.
It remained in the seat after the event, without loss of knowledge at the time of arrival of the paramedics.
It was transported with collaring and immobilized in dorsal decubitus on the protection table and was admitted to the UPD.
15min after the accident.
Vital signs at admission: temperature, 36.4oC; pulse, 76; BP, 109/69 mm Hg; and respiratory rate, 14.
The patient remained calm and very cooperative, and only complained of mild abdominal pain during exercise in the UPD.
Initial abdominal ultrasound and X-rays were normal, as were laboratory studies (blood and urine) and the rest of the physical examination.
It was decided to keep her under observation.
After a few hours, the patient continued with mild abdominal pain, and a contrast CAT scan was performed.
In evaluating the CT the case was discussed with our department.
At this time the patient had 5hrs under observation, stable.
CT showed the right kidney without contrast uptake.
It was decided to manage conservatively.
She was discharged after 36h of observation.
