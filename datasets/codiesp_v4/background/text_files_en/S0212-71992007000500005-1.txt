A 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, with frequent exacerbations requiring corticosteroid treatment.
She came to the emergency department with high fever, cough, expectoration, dyspnea and pain in the right hemithorax.
Chest X-ray confirmed the existence of pneumonia in the right lower lobe.
Treatment was initiated with bronchodilators, corticosteroids and levofloxacin (500 mg/day).
On the third day after starting treatment, the patient presented pain and swelling of both Achilles tendons, with marked functional impotence.
A diagnosis of bilateral Achilles tendinitis due to levofloxacin is made, so this treatment is suspended, rest is recommended and the condition resolves in eighteen days.
