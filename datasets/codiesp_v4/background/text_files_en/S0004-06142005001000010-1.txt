A 55-year-old male presented with a 1-year history of hematospermia.
No relevant medical history was reported.
On physical examination, rectal examination is normal, with an adenomatous prostate median volume.
Blood tests, urine and semen culture, and PSA values were normal.
Transrectal ultrasound showed a cyst of the MÃ¼llerian duct located in the midline, with a hyperechoic wall and an echogenic mass in its interior with a diameter of 0.5 cm.
It was decided to perform a transurethral endoscopic examination of the cavity.
The conventional cavity is only observed in its groove. With Collins' cuch, the cavity is weaned from the verumontanum and with the ball no hemostasis of the inner edges of the lithiasis is performed
Endoscopic cyst inspection allows visualization of ejaculatory ducts.
At one year of follow-up the patient is asymptomatic and has not presented hematospermia again.
Transrectal ultrasound performed during follow-up showed the disappearance of the cyst.
