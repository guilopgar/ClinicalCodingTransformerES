In a 34-year-old patient previously diagnosed with colonic Crohn's disease, involvement of the small intestine was suspected and a CE study was indicated.
She had symptoms that led to suspicion of stenosis, so it was decided to check intestinal permeability before using an Agile® capsule.
Approximately 30 hours after administration she developed severe abdominal pain, dyspnoea and vomiting.
A computerized axial tomography (CAT) was performed, diagnosing an intestinal obstruction secondary to the impaction of Agile® in an ileal stenosis, with dilation of the proximal loops and edema of its walls.
Although the patient improved with the administration of analgesia and the placement of a nasogastric tube, it was decided to intervene, aiming at ileal stenosis with mild edema of the proximal loops, without dilation of the proximal loops.
The affected segment was resected and the capsule was not found during surgery.
