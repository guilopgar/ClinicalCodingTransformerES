A 45-year-old male, long-term smoker.
In May 2011, the patient was admitted with sudden onset of moderate intensity oppressive chest pain associated with neurovegetative symptoms.
The patient had an evolving ECG, mainly due to a low level in left precordial leads, and enzyme elevation.
Having a history of allergy to aspirin reported by the patient (generalized erythema after two doses), a decision was made before the invasive study was made to perform a screening protocol that was completed without incidents during monitoring in the Coronary Care Unit.
Subsequently, coronary angiography showed significant lesion in the circumflex artery, which was treated with angioplasty and stent implantation.
Aspirin was not associated with complications during the procedure.
After 9 months of follow-up, she had no adverse effects and maintained good adherence to therapy, without angina and without evidence of HAAS.
