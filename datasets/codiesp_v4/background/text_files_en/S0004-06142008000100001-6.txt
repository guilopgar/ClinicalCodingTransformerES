A 74-year-old patient underwent radical prostatectomy for organ-confined prostate cancer.
In the postoperative period, the patient has incontinence that progressively improves but does not disappear, so the patient resorts to a Cunningham clamp when she leaves home.
Five years after radical surgery and with complete response to treatment and undetectable PSA, a soft tumor was discovered in routine reviews immediately behind the area of compression of the pinch and confirmed as diverticulum.
Partial resection of the pardes of the sac and reconstruction of the urethra by overlapping the sac flaps following the Radojicic technique (10) are used, adding the reinforcement of a mersilene mesh.
He had a catheter for 3 weeks and at 3 months there was minimal urinary leakage at the level of the repair preserving an excellent urethral caliber.
A permanent catheter was placed which had to be replaced by 'cysto cath' for periurethral abscess that responded well with antibiotic treatment, with removal one month later without having to remove the mesh.
