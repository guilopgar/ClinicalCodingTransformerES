A 53-year-old woman presented in consultation due to occasional pain in the left lower arch.
He said he had to take several analgesics and/or suffer episodes of exacerbation.
The inspection showed a mesiodistal fissure in the crown of the lower left second molar.
In the radiographic examination we found nothing special.
Pain was solved with a camera opening of the tooth, placement of a medication (Cresophene, Septodont) and closure with a temporary cement (Cavit, Espe).
We proposed a posterior endodontic procedure and placement of a metal-porcelain crown.
The day we had planned to do the endodontics came with the fractured tooth and we did the extraction.
The tooth affected by tooth decay can be appreciated.
