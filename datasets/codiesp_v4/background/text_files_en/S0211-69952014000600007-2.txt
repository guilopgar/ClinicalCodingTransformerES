A 40-year-old male with a two-cuffed neck catheter implanted six years earlier.
Three years after the start of the PD program, the external cuff was extruded as part of the treatment of a recurrent infection of the exit site.
Three years later, during a periodic review, the inspection revealed a small hole near the remnants of the extruded external cuff.
The hole did not reach the lumen of the catheter, but to prevent complete perforation, we reinforced it.
To do so, we wrapped the perforation point with the mold and filled it with the silicone adhesive.
The extension catheter segment of the kit was not necessary in this case, since there was no complete rupture.
Dialysis was not interconnected and there were no complications after the procedure.
