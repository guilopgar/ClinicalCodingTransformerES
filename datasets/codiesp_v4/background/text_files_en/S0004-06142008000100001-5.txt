The patient was 68 years old and underwent transurethral resection of the bladder with different control endoscopies using a rigid instrument.
In one of them prebulbar urethral stenosis was discovered and Sachse was practiced.
In the following endoscopic control, a year later, a diverticular orifice in the prebulbar urethra of low capacity was observed, so a spective behavior was decided, given that due to its bladder pathology it will follow periodic endoscopic controls.
At 2 years this spectator attitude was maintained.
