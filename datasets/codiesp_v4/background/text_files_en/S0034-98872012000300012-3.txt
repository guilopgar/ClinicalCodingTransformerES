A 19-year-old female patient with a rural residence in the IX region, with no morbid history.
She presented with a 5-month history of symptoms secondary to intracraneal hypertension syndrome (recurrent and progressive migraine associated with vomiting, refractory to medical treatment and bilateral papillary oedema marked at the bottom of the eye).
Brain CT and MRI showed a large left temporal intraxial cystic formation, with a diameter of 60 mm, similar to the previous cases, with a moderate mass effect on the adjacent parenchyma and ventricular system of 5.5 mm, with line deviation.
The study with chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound showed no cystic lesions.
Complete blood count and liver tests were normal.
The diagnosis was left temporal hydatid cyst.
Intact excision of the lesion was performed, confirming the histopathological study hydatid etiology.
The patient was admitted favorably, without neurological deficit or postoperative complications.
