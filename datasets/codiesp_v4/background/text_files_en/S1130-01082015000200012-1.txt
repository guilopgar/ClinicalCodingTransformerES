A 49-year-old woman presented with 3-week history of diarrhea, 3-4 stools a day, liquid, with abundant air-fluid sounds, without pathological products, abdominal pain, rectal tenesmus.
It is accompanied by a loss of 2 kg of weight without loss of appetite or nocturnal episodes.
Your primary care doctor will tell you loperamide 1 mg every 8 hours to control your diarrhoea.
She says that the onset of symptoms begins with taking a herbal product for insomnia, without using other medications.
A study including blood count, hepatic and renal profile, thyroid stimulating hormone, vitamin B12, folic acid, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, immunoglobulin A, antitransglutaminase tissue and antiendoscopic stool study was requested.
These results are discussed in the composition of the product used for insomnia corresponding to melatonin in doses of 5 mg a day.
If there is a temporal relationship between taking it and the onset of diarrhea, its use is suspended and symptoms completely disappear.
The patient restarts melatonin treatment at the same doses, reappearing clinically.
Subsequently, melatonin was administered at a dose of 1.8 mg per day to control insomnia and without side effects.
