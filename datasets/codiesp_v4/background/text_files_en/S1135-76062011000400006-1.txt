We report the case of a young adolescent who suffered a single stab wound in the right hemithorax and was abandoned to the doors of an emergency department.
She was treated surgically with placement of a pericardiotomy, evacuation of the hemopericardium and repair of the incise lesion in the right atrium with section of the right coronary artery.
Despite the treatment, the patient died and a forensic autopsy was performed.
