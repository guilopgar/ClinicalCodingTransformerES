A 19-year-old female patient with a history of hypothyroidism and nephrotic syndrome secondary to focal segmental glomerulonephritis, presented with chronic renal failure.
With no development of vascular bed, a permanent jugular venous catheter was installed under conditions in May 2009, starting hemodialysis three weeks without catheter.
In June 2010, the patient had a one-month history of fever intra- and post-dialysis, with records of up to 39Â° C, without compromising general status, which was subsequently added anorexia and frank anaemia.
On admission, no infectious focus was found in the respiratory, genitourinary and gastrointestinal systems and the skin in relation to the catheter was without secretion or erythema.
In addition to laboratory tests, the following stood out: normocytic normochromic anemia with hemoglobin of 6.2 g/dl and hematocrit of 17.9%, leucopenia of 3,700/mm3 and vascular culture suspicious peripheral catheter vancomycin was requested.
On the third day, in both hemocultives and catheter culture, the Vitek2 equipment identified in Biomeriux (99% specificity) was placed on the Vitek.
In the antibiogram, the microorganism was found to be susceptible to amikacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin, meropenem and imipenem and resistant to ceftazidimesul, leprofloxacin and ampicillin
Emerged in good general conditions with decreased inflammatory parameters in the long term.
Currently, the patient is on hemodialysis catheter waiting for definitive vascular access.
