A 64-year-old male smoker with no relevant medical or surgical history was admitted for hemoptysis and was diagnosed with lung cancer.
During the same admission she presented with abdominal pain and severe anemia requiring transfusion of several concentrates.
An extension study was performed with a computed tomography (CT), which found a small bowel tumor.
Due to the persistence of bleeding symptoms, exploratory laparoscopy was performed, observing a proximal jejunal tumor and performing resection of the same.
The patient had an uneventful postoperative course.
Pathology of the excised specimen confirmed the diagnosis of metastasis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin.
Four months later resection of the primary lung tumor was performed, and nine months later the patient is receiving adjuvant cancer treatment without evidence of recurrence.
