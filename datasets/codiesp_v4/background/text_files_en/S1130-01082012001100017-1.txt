A 47-year-old patient was admitted in June 2010 for acute cholestatic hepatitis of probable ethylic origin.
She had a history of paranoid schizophrenia treated with olanzapine 10 mg/24 h for 11 months.
Although the initial clinical course was favorable, with normalization of liver function parameters (bilirubin and coagulation), cytolysis was increasingly accentuated.
Complete etiologic study (virus, autoantibodies, drugs, etc.) was negative.
As cases of hepatotoxicity have been described in the literature, olanzapine is discontinued and replaced by haloperidol, its evident improvement in cytolysis up to total normalization.
