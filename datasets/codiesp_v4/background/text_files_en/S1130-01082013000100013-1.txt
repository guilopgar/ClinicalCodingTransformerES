A 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia treated, ex-smoker, gastric ulcus 5 years earlier, non-small cell lung cancer (T1N0M0) diagnosed and operated on
Complementary examinations performed at admission showed hemoglobin of 7.3 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume of 76fl, slight thrombocytosis with normal leukocyte count and formula; biochemical tests showed normal renal function.
After transfusing three concentrates, the patient improved clinically and underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE) without evidence of lesions in the esophagus, stomach or duodenum.
Persistence of anemia in subsequent analytical controls was programmed as not presenting lesions proximal to the hepatic angle.
Selective arteriography showed a bleeding lesion in the small intestine, at the level of the jejunum, which was surgically resected a few days later.
Histopathological study of the sample was compatible with metastasis of large cell lung carcinoma.
Subsequently, PET-CT ruled out metastatic disease in other locations.
