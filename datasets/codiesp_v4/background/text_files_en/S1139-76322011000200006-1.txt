We report the case of a well-controlled pregnancy and normal delivery, with a physical examination at birth, except for a small cutaneous hemangioma in the right hypochondrium.
At 45 days of life she presented a pale macule in the upper lip that resembled hemangioma.
At three months, the lesion hindered suction and distressed the family because it was in a very visible location.
According to the Pediatric Surgery Department, after a normal ultrasound and electrocardiogram, it was decided to start outpatient treatment with propranolol at four months of age due to the possible aesthetic and functional repercussions of the hemangioma.
The medication was administered in a single dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day.
The response to propoololol was good treatment, with growth of the lesion during the first two months and progressively decreasing in the following months, so the dose was reduced to 1 mg/kg/day after three months of treatment.
The evolution of the hypochondrium angioma was parallel to that of the lip.
Regular ambulatory blood pressure, heart rate and blood glucose monitoring were performed, which remained within normal limits.
The patient did not experience serious adverse effects, although the first months showed greater restlessness and difficulty sleeping, as well as moderate flattening of the curve, which was corrected by decreasing the dose of propranol.

At the present time, at 17 months, the child is asymptomatic at a weight percentile appropriate for his age; the hemangioma has not increased in size again and does not produce any functional repercussion.
