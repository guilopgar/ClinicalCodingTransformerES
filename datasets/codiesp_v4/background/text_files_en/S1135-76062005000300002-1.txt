A young man remains detained in a police station for four days.
Twenty-four hours after being released, she attends a hospital facility for seizures.
The reason for consultation is a clinical picture of severe asthenia and myalgias located in regions of tapered spine.
On physical examination no more clinical data were observed.
Blood and urine tests were performed in which there was an elevation of CK in blood at admission of 2,617 IU/lit with a fraction of CK-MB of 5 %.
We performed an abdominal ultrasound study and a chest X-ray study that did not provide pathological data.
The patient was discharged the following day with a clinical diagnosis of mild (uncomplicated) rhabdomyolysis.
CK values at clinical discharge, 8 hours after admission, were 1,299 IU/lit.
The patient is evaluated in the service of Bilbao Forensic Medical Clinic three months later by a complaint of police abuse during his stay in the police center [1].
The inmate reported that he had been the subject of occasional blows with his hand open in his head and testicles, accompanied by verbal threats, as well as sessions in which he held a plastic bag.
During these sessions, the patient was afflicted with coughing up the airflow without unconsciousness; he received shaking and hitting his head.
These sessions lasted about 3 or 4 hours and were followed by rest episodes of about 2 hours.
He reported that he did not refer anything to the forensic doctor who treats him every day in police stations.
He was allowed to rest for a couple of hours before he was seen by that forensic doctor, he said.
