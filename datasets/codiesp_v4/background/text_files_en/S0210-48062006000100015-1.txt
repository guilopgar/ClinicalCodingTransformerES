A 53-year-old male presented at the Urology Department of the Hospital POA due to a six-month history of exophytic growth lesion on the glans.
Two years before, the patient had undergone a biopsy of a papular lesion with erythematous and blistering areas located in the same area, which was histologically diagnosed as hypertrophic flat liquen.
The residual lesion was then treated with liquid nitrogen, although it did not completely disappear.
At present, a complete excision of the tumor measuring 1 x 0.4 cm was performed, and microscopically it had a verrucous architecture, with a broad base and a well-defined lower limit.
The lesion showed acanthosis, papillomatosis and orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis of the epithelium, with papillae of similar size, and almost inappreciable fibrovascular axes.
From the cytological point of view, the tumor cells showed minimal cytological atypia, without the presence of mitosis or coilocytic changes.
A molecular biology study was performed for detection and typing of the human papilloma virus (HPV), which was negative.
The diagnosis was verrucous carcinoma of the glans on a previous area of hypertrophic flat liquen.
