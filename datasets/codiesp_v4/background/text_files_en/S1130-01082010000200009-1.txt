A 50-year-old woman with heartburn and acid regurgitation was referred to our department for scheduled oral endoscopy.
In this examination more than 100 millimetric lesions were found, rounded, raised and white-yellowish, diffusely distributed throughout the esophagus and were histologically identified as glands.
