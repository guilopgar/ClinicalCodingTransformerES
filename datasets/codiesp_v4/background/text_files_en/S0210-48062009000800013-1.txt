We report a case of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection caused by C. striatum in an outpatient setting without risk factors.
A 34-year-old woman, with no history of interest, came to her bedside physician for dysuria maintained up to half an hour after micturition, accompanied by microhematuria, and was referred by a doctor.
A systematic urine analysis, a uroculture and an ultrasound of the urinary tract were requested.
Urine and sediment analysis detected 20-30 leukocytes/field dyspareunia after 10% acetic acid.
No morphological or functional changes were observed on ultrasound.
To perform the urine culture, the urine sample was plated on blood agar and CLED agar, and incubated at 37 oC in aerobiosis.
After 24 h of incubation, a punctiform growth was observed in the blood plate in pure culture > 100,000c/ml, and reinstatement of plaques was observed another day.
After 48 h of staining with Column-001rie, some white colonies with a creamy appearance were observed, which, by Gram stain, corresponded to a diphteroid Gram-positive bacillus, 99% Aileynebacter
The possibility of being a contamination of the external genital tract, a new sample was requested, obtaining the same result.
Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by the E-test method (AB Biodisc Sweden), at the Clinical Laboratory Muns Hinton 5% Standard lamb blood supplemented with Streptococcus virida (CL National Committee for susceptibility).
The strain was sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, clinmycin and vancomycin, and was resistant to clarithromycin, and acrylamide, tetracycline and erythromycin.
Empirical treatment with ciprofloxacin 500 mg/12 h orally was initiated, which lasted for one week after confirmation of the antibiogram.
After 48 h of treatment hematuria and symptoms disappeared.
Subsequently, a control uroculture was performed which yielded negative results.
