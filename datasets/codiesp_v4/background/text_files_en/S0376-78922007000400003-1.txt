A 12-year-old patient aspect at the time of diagnosis is shown in Figure 1. In addition to dermatological alterations, marked subdermal subdermal plexus and physical discomfort for the patient due to physical discomfort and discomfort.
Pathological examination of biopsy obtained by puncture aspiration, tissue mammary proliferation of both stroma and stroma was performed, with difficulty to differentiate them from secondary fibroadenoma patterns. The possible hormonal therapeutic proposals already explained were excluded.
The treatment consisted of a reduction mammoplasty with Wise ÃÅs pattern in dermal marking; size was widened so as to reduce the sensitivity of the fixed horizontal flap and preserving Thdermization.
We used autologous flap material for filling, thus avoiding the use of prosthesis.
The resection in the right breast was 1,050 grams of weight and in the left it reached 1,800 grams.
Drains were placed in both breasts that were removed 48 hours later. The patient was discharged from hospital with a good evolution, without complications and with the same pathological diagnosis of hypertrophy epithelium with proliferative pattern of stroma and fibroadenoma.

The aspect of the recent result, a few months after the intervention, can be seen in Figures 3: there are breasts in which there is a notable difference in the previous situation regarding the size and age of the patient, but with a notable difference

The later result, already at 17 years and 6 months of age of the patient, presents a size and a shape of the breasts more proportionate to the age and circumstances of the patient; there has been an acceptable rejection of the breast appearance.
