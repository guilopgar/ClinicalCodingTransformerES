A 6-year-old female patient presented with a 4-month history of swelling at the mandibular level on the right side, with rapid growth and slight pain at the level of the lesion.
Intraoral expansion of mandibular cortical bones at molar level.
Three-dimensional tomography confirmed extensive bone destruction.
Histopathological result, mandibular osteoblastoma.
Given the extensive destruction and aggressive local behavior of the lesion, right hemimandibulectomy is performed, and a mandibular reconstruction prosthesis is placed with condyle in the surgical bed.
Postoperative control with good oral opening, without damage to nerve structures of importance, maintaining continuity of sensory (lower dental) and motor nerves.
The patient underwent 6 months after the initial surgery, placement of a bone matrix mixed with bone aspirate in the surgical bed, observing a year and posterior half slight bone formation and satisfactory oral opening as well as excellent dental occlusion.
