A 78-year-old male diagnosed with senile dementia is diagnosed with ocular surface disease due to the appearance of a raised neoformation in the left eye for several months.
Among the visually impaired eyes, emphasis is placed on the realization of phacoemulsification and implantation of intraocular lens in both eyes seven years earlier, as well as a severe bilateral atrophic macular degeneration that reduces visual acuity at counting level.
Biomicroscopic examination showed a gelatinous limbal lesion with an approximate extension of 240o and abundant superficial vascular dilatations.
The lesion was clinically diagnosed as a probable extensive CIN in the left eye.
Topical treatment was started with INFÎ±-2b 1 million IU/ml (INTRON A, Skelough, Kenilworth, NJ), 1 drop 4 times a day.
The patient was reviewed 15 days after starting treatment, and monthly until the lesion resolved.
The first review showed a reduction in the height of the lesion and disappearance of its temporal sector.
At 2 months, the lesion had reduced its extension to about 120o, disappearing completely at 4 months.
The treatment was continued for another 1 month without observing side effects.
Currently, with a 2-year follow-up, no signs of recurrence have been detected.
