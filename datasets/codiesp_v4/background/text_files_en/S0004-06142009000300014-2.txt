We report the case of a 66-year-old man who underwent excision of a 6 cm paratesticular mass in 2000, with an atypical pathological diagnosis.
Six years after surgery, the patient came to our clinic for palpable inguinal tumor.
Testicular ultrasound showed a solid, vascularized, homogeneous paratesticular mass with well-defined borders of 5 cm. Testicular markers and extension study with CT and bone scintigraphy were negative.
1.
In the inguinal surgical exploration a mass very adhered to the cord was found. It has a heterogeneous appearance and is characterized by excision of the lesion accompanied by right inguinal orchiectomy with high ligature of the cord.
Histologically, it corresponded to a cord LPS without surgical margins or testicular involvement.
Chemotherapy was not administered because there was no postoperative residual disease.
Due to the recurrent nature of the lesion and the high-grade histological subtype of LPS, adjuvant radiotherapy was applied to the tumor bed.
One year after surgery the patient is asymptomatic and without evidence of tumor recurrence.
