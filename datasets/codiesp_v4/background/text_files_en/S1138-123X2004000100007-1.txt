A 12-year-old male consulting for a gingival lesion since his early childhood with occasional bleeding without pain.
Intraoral examination revealed a reddish, pressure-gland tumor at the interincisal level, similar to a reddish granuloma on the red surface, but with some small red vesicles.
In the papilla separating the 12th from the 13th, a reddish lesion with small papillary projections raised, a size of an alfiler head, and between both lesions, tiny areas of color are observed.
A reddish lesion with papillary elevations similar to those described in the vestibular area is also observed in the gingival portion inserted in the palatal region between 12 and 13.

A biopsy was taken in the vestibular lesion area from 12 to 13, which was reported as hemolymphangioma.
