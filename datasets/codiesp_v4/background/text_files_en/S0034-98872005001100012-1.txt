A 15-year-old woman, with no history of morbid disease or local trauma, with increased volume in the cheek and right malar of 6 months prior to consultation, initially treated as an abscess of dental origin.
Physical examination revealed a firm, fixed and slightly painful swelling in the right upper jaw region, with occupation of the right upper vestibule and extension to the hard palate and blocking rights.
Ultrasound showed a solid-cystic mass with a net contours of 7 x 5 x 5 cm, in relation to deep facial muscle planes of the malar region and filling the maxillary sinus.
In the computerized axial tomography (CAT) of paranasal cavities, an expansive process was observed, solid cystic, from the fifth fragment upper right dental, occupying the entire ventral cavity and the right maxillary horn extending towards the fifth orbital cavity.
An incisional biopsy was performed, which diagnosis was: aneurysmal bone cyst.
Two months later, the tumor mass occupying the entire right maxillary sinus was removed, with destruction of its anterior and medial wall, bone palate and superior alveolar ridge.
Extensive extraction was performed by means of infrastructure maxillectomy, which consists of removing the aforementioned structures, preserving the floor of the orbit.
Macroscopically, the surgical specimen showed an expansive, well-defined lesion composed of multiple cavities separated by a reddish brown septum filled with tapered material.
Microscopic examination revealed the presence of numerous septa separating cavities, without endothelial lining, with irregular size and void content.
The septa had fibrous stroma, multinucleated giant cells, signs of old hemorrhage and areas with osteoid tissue, without evidence of anaplasia.
No mitotic activity was observed.
No coexistence with other lesions was found.
The patient remains in permanent controls, progressing favorably.
