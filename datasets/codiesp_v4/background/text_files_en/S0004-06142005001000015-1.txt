A 19-year-old male patient came to the emergency department after a motor vehicle traffic accident.
She had no urological history.
The patient complained of severe abdominal pain.
Physical examination revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15 points, with a painful mass in the left upper quadrant associated with significant abdominal disfunction.
He had macrohematuria at spontaneous micturition.
The patient remained silently stable at all times, but during the initial evaluation the hematocrit dropped 10 points.
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a horseshoe kidney with a fracture in the junction zone between the lower pole of the left kidney and the isthmus, showing active hemorrhage and extensive retroperitoneal hematoma (10x7x23 cm).
Delayed sections showed contrast extravasation compatible with an important urinoma.
1.
An arteriography was performed, showing a double dye compatible with each kidney and a common distal lumborenal trunk that gave accessory branches to the lower poles of both kidneys and the isthmus with active contrast extravasation.
The lumborenal trunk was selectively catheterized, aiming at the branch of the left kidney and isthmus allowing its embolization with polyvinyl alcohol particles, without immediate complications.
The urinary tract was catheterized retrogradely with a ureteral catheter to facilitate the drainage of the urinoma.
1.
In the following days, the patient was asymptomatic with complete resolution of the pain and hematuria, with stable leakage and a control CT that showed no signs of bleeding, with complete resolution of the urinoma and no signs of urinoma.
Three months after embolization, control CT showed complete resolution of the hematoma.
There were no late complications, maintaining normal renal function and blood pressure at 12 months follow-up.
