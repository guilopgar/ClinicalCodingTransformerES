A 12-year-old 11-month-old gypsy woman with no relevant medical or dental history was referred.
Location that for more than three months presented a lump in the left upper jaw.
The clinical examination showed a dark red tumor, hard consistency, painless and without spontaneous bleeding, about 3 cm in diameter.
The lesion was not ulcerated and affected the vestibular gingiva of the left hemipaladar, from the first premolar to the first molar area, being well delimited and, in part, pedunculated.
The apexification of the lesion was painful.
Multiple caries and poor hygiene were also observed.
Dental eruption in both arches was normal except for the absence of molar 17 and premolar 25.
1.
The panoramic and periapical radiographs revealed some delay in molar eruption 17, agenesis of premolar 25 and osteolytic defect between premolar 24 and molar displacement 26, without resorption or root displacement
Computed axial tomography revealed absence of involvement of neighboring, nasal or sinus areas.
A biopsy was performed and the histopathological study corresponded to a giant cell granuloma.
The lesion appeared covered on its surface by a squamous epithelium without dysplastic phenomena; the neighboring lamina propria showed abundant polymorphonuclear leukocytes, as well as frequent multinucleated giant cells and adequate vascularization.
The treatment consisted of removal of the tumor, milling of the alveolar bone, extraction of 24 and 26 encompassed by the lesion and repair of the lytic defect.
The evolution was satisfactory and no recurrence was observed at four years.
