A ten-year-old girl was seen in the emergency room for loss of knowledge of about 4 minutes while she was doing gymnastics at school, without sphincter relaxation, or accompanying tonic-clonic movements.
Family history: she has no history of syncope or sudden death.
Personal history without interest.
The patient remained stable in the emergency room with a normal physical examination, blood tests and rest electrocardiogram.
1.
She was admitted under observation in the Pediatrics ward, monitored, with no incidents.
The following complementary tests were performed: normal echocardiogram, electrocardiogram (ECG) normal ECG-Holter.
Ergometry, at peak exertion at 178-180 beats per minute, shows bigeminism and couples of ventricular extrasystoles (VRS) with asymptomatic morphology of right bundle branch block (BRD).
1.
These findings are derived to the Arrhythmia Unit of the Vall d'HebrÃ³n Hospital.
A provocation test is carried out with frequent voiding episodes as from stage 3 with bigeminism, followed by bidirectional VoiSS couples and even a saved bidirectional ventricular tachycardia
The test is considered positive for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).
A arrhythmias detector was implanted subcutaneously and treatment with nadolol 20 mg/12 h was initiated.
At regular visits, the patient reported no symptoms and the electrocardiograms were normal.
Two months after starting treatment, the patient is asymptomatic, the ECG-Holter is normal, and no electrocardiographic changes were observed at 66% of the predicted 20 mg heart rate on exercise testing (treatment for his age).
A genetic study was performed on the parents, and the mother was positive for the variant c.7426T>A (p.Tyr2476Asn) in the RYR2 gene, responsible for CVT.
