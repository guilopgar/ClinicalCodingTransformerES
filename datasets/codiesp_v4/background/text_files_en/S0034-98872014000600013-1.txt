We report the case of a 31-year-old female patient with no relevant morbid history, with a 3-month history of back pain, physical examination and laboratory tests within normal ranges.
A chest X-ray showed a lesion in the right mid-posterior mediastinum.
A computed tomography (CT) study was completed, which showed a posterior mediastinal tumor suggestive of paralysis.
Surgical resection of the lesion was performed with intraoperative biopsy that showed Castleman's disease (CD) of hyaline vascular type; after which the patient was studied to rule out systemic involvement, presenting favorable evolution.
Macroscopic examination revealed a 29 g oval mediastinal tumor, 5 cm x 4.5 cm per 2 cm, with a pinkish pinkish surface in homogeneous granular parts, with an end appearance similar to the pinkish cut surface.

Microscopic examination revealed characteristic lymphoid angiofollicular hyperplasia with arrangement of lymphocytes in " onion plate" around.
Immunohistochemistry showed a reactive pattern with Bcl-2(-), CD3 reactive cells (sp7) (+), CD10 (-), CD20 (++), CD43 centrogerminal cells (+30), reactive cells.
