A four-year-old normal-configured girl with no family history of interest was referred to the Pediatric Gastroenterology Department of our hospital for change in bowel habits.
In the last four months, it went from emitting a normal deposition every other day to emitting one or two daily, soft stools with mucus and red blood cells.
There was no abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, hypoxia or asthenia.
Ascending height curve.
The mother reported neither the appearance of oral aphthous ulcers nor cutaneous, articular or perianal lesions.
His personal history included allergy to hazelnuts and white fish, as well as repeated episodes of bronchospasm related to respiratory infections.
For the management of these episodes, your pediatrician prescribed inhaled albuterol in a pressurized chamber, administered on demand; and for six months montelukast, at a rate of 4 mg daily.
The Gastroenterology consultation requested hemogram, general biochemistry, immunoglobulin A, celiac antibodies, coagulation study, coprocultive, and detection of viruses and feces with negative results.
The day the mother was informed of the arrival of the results, she told us that she had stopped the administration of montelukast, because she had read in the package leaflet that her chronological administration increased the risk of intestinal suppression.
In fact, it remains normal after 12 months of follow-up.
