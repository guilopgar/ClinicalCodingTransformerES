A 38-year-old male diagnosed with BE in 1986, with a history of anterior uveitis with hypopion in the RE, recurrent aphthous ulcers and thromboflebitis in the left lower extremity.
The patient was treated with prednisone and cyclosporine, but had an average of 3 uveitis relapses per year until 1997.
In 1999, cyclosporine had to be switched to mycophenolate mofetil due to nephrotoxicity with renal insufficiency and hypertension.
Treatment for corticosteroid induced colitis was also required.
The patient had not suffered a relapse since 1997 but PACG was initiated in an effort to reduce maintenance doses of drugs.
The VA was light perception in two quadrants in the RE and 0.6 in the LE.
