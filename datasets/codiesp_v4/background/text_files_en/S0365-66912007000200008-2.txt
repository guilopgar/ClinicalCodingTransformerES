It had been reviewed in another center without any alteration.
He came to the hospital complaining of difficulty focusing and differentiating colors for two months.
The VA was 1 in AO, biomycosis and normal controls.
A reduction in central and paracentral threshold values was observed in AP.
In the INT presented (15 slides) 6 failures in the RE and 5 failures in the LE.
The aspect of the eye fundus showed the characteristic image of hyperpigmentation in the eyebrow.
Chloroquine treatment was withdrawn but continued to worsen.
At two months the VA was 7/10 for the RE and 8/10 for the LE.
A frequency duplication perimetry was performed, presenting threshold values of 0 dB at central level.
At 6 months the VA dropped to 4/10 in BE.
BP was repeated with the 10-2 strategy, which showed in more detail the central visual field defect.
The evoked visual potentials and the electroretinogram were normal; however, the electrooculography showed decreased values.
The funduscopic appearance was similar.
In the following reviews no changes were observed.
