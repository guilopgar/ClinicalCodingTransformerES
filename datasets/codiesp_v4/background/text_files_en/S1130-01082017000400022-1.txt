We present three cases of pseudocystosis jejunal that debuted as acute abdomen.
The first case was a 75-year-old man who presented with intestinal obstruction.
Abdominal CT scan suggested bridle or internal hernia, so surgery was decided.
Second, a 90-year-old woman who came to the emergency department for vomiting.
Abdominal CT showed no obstructive cause.
After 24 hours of conservative management she suffered worsening.
Pneumoperitoneum was observed in abdominal CT, so surgery was performed.
Finally, a 75-year-old man presented with abdominal pain.
Abdominal CT reports small bowel diverticulum perforation, so she is taken to the operating room.
In the first two cases, an obstructive cause was observed in the small intestine with the presence of proximal jejunal pseudodiverticula; in the second and third cases, one of these had a perforation.
The treatment consisted of intestinal resection of the affected segment and primary anastomosis.
The postoperative course was uneventful.
The anatomopathological report confirmed the presence of false diverticula in yey, in two perforated cases, without malignant data.
