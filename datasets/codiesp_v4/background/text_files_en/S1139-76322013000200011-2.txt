A ten-year-old patient presented to the clinic due to changes in the first nail of the left foot.
On physical examination, a thickened distal nail plate was observed. It appeared to be replaced proximally by a new one with a normal appearance.
In the anamnesis, the parents reported that a few weeks before the child had presented periungual inflammation (paroniquia), of unknown etiology and that it had been resolved with topical antibiotic treatment.
