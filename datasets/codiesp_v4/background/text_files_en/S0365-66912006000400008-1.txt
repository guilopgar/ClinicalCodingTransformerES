A 37-year-old man with no relevant past medical history developed a conjunctival mass in the right eye (OD) for 8 months.
Clinically, a pigmented mass was found on the nasal conjunctiva that affected part of the cornea but did not affect the visual axis.
Initial exploration revealed visual acuity of 20/20 and intraocular pressure of 12 mmHg in both eyes.
Both indirect ophthalmoscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy in the left eye were normal.
The biomycosis of the right eye revealed a high 9 x 4 mm mass with well-defined borders located in the bulbar conjunctiva and pigmented portion of the nasal sector.
The mass was surrounded by some prominent nutritional vessels.
There was no evidence of acquired primary injury adjacent to the lesion.
The rest of the exploration, including the fundus, was normal.
Complete excision of the lesion with wide surgical margins was performed.
Macroscopic examination revealed a nodular lesion measuring 8 x 4 x 3 mm, multilobulated outer surface, brown color and mucous appearance.
Histopathological examination showed conjunctival epithelium lining with changes in papillomatosis and irregular acanthosis, the latter due to small proliferation of basaloid cells, which were mixed with groups of squamous cells and some others.
The substance itself also had areas with elastotic degeneration, small blood vessels dilated and numerous variables of infiltrate formed by mature lymphocytes, plasma cells and some inflammatory cells.
With these findings the diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis (SK) of the conjunctiva was established.
