A 48-year-old woman with a bicuspid aortic valve presented with mild regurgitation, rosacea acne and stenosistectomized.
She was admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain located in the left flank.
The urine test showed 7-10 parasites per field, leukocytes 4-6 per field and absence of bacteria.
Urine nitrogen 21.8 mg/dl, plasma creatinine 0.59 mg/dl, creatinine clearance 24 h 109.7 ml/min/1.73m2 and 24 h proteinuria negative.
Normal plasma electrolytes, blood glucose 89 mg/dl, C-reactive protein < 5 mg/L (VN: 0.10-8.2).
Hematocrit 40.3%, hemoglobin 13.8 g/dl, leukocytes 7,400 mm3, platelets 283,000 mm3 and ESR 1 mm/h.
Due to the pain and hematuria, an abdominal scan was performed, which showed a multilocular cystic mass in the hilium of the left kidney, protruding towards the retroperitoneum and not contrast-enhanced with the use.
A left renal cystic lymphangioma was diagnosed.
As pain disappeared with analgesic therapy, it was decided not to intervene and to continue an annual observation.
