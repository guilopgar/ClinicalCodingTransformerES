This is a 65-year-old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus as the only risk factor for the development of liver abscess (1).
For this reason, he was admitted in May 2012 in our hospital, with the isolation of pneumonia that was treated with 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotic treatment (picutaziline-taccineo Klebsiella via ultrasound) and percutaneous drainage
Ten months later, he presented a new liver abscess by the same microorganism in the same location, also resolved conservatively.
Since liver abscesses may have as origin a neoplasic focus at colonic level (1.2), we requested a sentinel lymph node that showed a colonic tubulovellous adenoma with high grade dysplasia.
Adenoma biopsies were cultured and Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from a biotype similar to that isolated in the abscess culture.
Seven months after the end of the abscess treatment and five months after endoscopic removal of the polyp, the patient remains asymptomatic.
