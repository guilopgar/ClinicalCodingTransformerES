A 14-year-old male presented with a mandibulo-temporo-cervical tumor of several months duration at the time of the first consultation.
We confirmed the presence of an abscess extending from the left parotid region throughout the masticatory space, ipsilateral pterygoid muscles and infratemporal fossa (confirmed by MRI).
We drained the abscess and cultured for anaerobic bacteria of the drenated material that was positive; the osteomyelitis pyogenic focus was cleaned.
The pathology study confirmed the diagnosis of Noma disease given the component of acute and chronic inflammation present histologically, without predominance of granulomas and median bone destruction of the temporal condyle.
