A 65-year-old patient, with no relevant medical history, attended outpatient urology clinics for total macroscopic hematuria with an episode of AUR.
The ultrasound showed a heterogeneous left renal mass of 7.7 * 7.2 * 7.
In view of these findings, an abdominal CAT scan showed a hypodense renal mass of 7.5 * 7 cm and irregular enhancement after contrast injection.
Left radical nephrectomy was performed by anterior subcostal approach.
The pathology report reveals a renal cell carcinoma of 8.5*8*7 cm pT2 N0 MX, Fuman grade III.
Follow-up six months after surgery using ABDOMEN CT scan, which showed no changes of interest.
At 11 months of treatment there is a soft mass in the root of the left lower limb extended to the iliac fossa, painless, non-ulcerated, which extends into the subcutaneous tissue of the neoform.

Surgery is performed by performing complete removal of a pseudocapsulated tumor that is dissected with some ease except in the lower face where it is intimately attached to deep planes developed with the presence of a more comprehensive approach.
Inguinal lymphadenectomy (negative extension) was performed simultaneously.
Histopathology showed sarcomatoid variant renal carcinoma with no lymph node involvement.
Follow-up: at 3, 6 and 12 months, the patient is asymptomatic and has no evidence of recurrence.
