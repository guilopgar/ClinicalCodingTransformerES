We report the case of a 30-year-old woman with portal cavernomatosis secondary to omphalitis with two derivative surgeries in childhood, multiple irregular varices due to multiple transfusing antibodies that had been systematically polygastric.
At 28 years of age, progressive thrombosis of the inferior vena cava and other territories was detected, which responded to conservative treatment.
Eleven days before admission, the patient presented a self-limiting "sentinel" hemorrhage requiring three tapered concentrates (CM), whose origin was not established due to diagnostic limitations resulting from simultaneous confirmation of pregnancy.
After curettage due to a failed pregnancy, she was admitted for a new hemorrhagic event secondary to collateral circulation of intermittent duodenal haemobilictysis detected by tomography and magnetic resonance [CT/MRI], cause.
Five concentrates were transfused, with practically no profitability.
During admission, she persisted with severe anemia without rebleeding and developed fever, pyrexia and hemolysis, with negative direct Coombs test.
She began treatment with corticosteroids and immunoglobulin.
The patient was discharged two weeks later with descending oral corticosteroids and did not require further transfusions.
