A 66-year-old woman presented with intermittent episodes of melena for one year.
Initial study with normal ADD.
She was admitted for a new episode of melena and anemization.
A new ADD is performed, together with intestinal transit followed by capsule endoscopy (CE) with no remarkable findings.
d Clinical diagnosis of OGIB requires angioTAC: "solid lesion hypercapnia 3,3 x 4,4 x 4,3 cm with exophytic growth from the light of an adenomatous GIST with arterial hypertrophy".
The patient was operated on: segmental resection of the iliac crest.
Histological and immunohistochemical study: GIST of low grade malignancy: size < 5 cm, < 1 mitosis/10 high-power fields, muscle differentiation and proliferative index < 1 %, measured with the monoclonal antibody KI67.
Complete tumor resection without metastatic involvement determines the absence of need for subsequent pharmacological treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib).
Three months later, the patient is asymptomatic.
