A 58-year-old male, ex-smoker, diagnosed with retroperitoneal germ cell tumor at 32 years of age requiring surgical intervention and chemotherapy with cisplatin.
It began four months earlier with diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea without pathological products.
Analytical analysis showed anemia of chronic disorders, impaired renal function and proteinuria in nephrotic range.
In the intestinal transit it presents edema pattern of distal ileum loops.
A gastroscopy was performed being normal, taking biopsies of second duodenal portion.
Pathological diagnosis was suggestive of ileal CD, confirmed in biopsies, and was also diagnosed with intestinal AA both at the duodenal and colon levels.
She was treated with corticosteroids and colchicine in the acute broth.
Currently, CD is in clinical and endoscopic remission, receiving treatment with 5-aminosalicylates, but proteinuria persists in non-nephrotic range and mild deterioration of renal function.
