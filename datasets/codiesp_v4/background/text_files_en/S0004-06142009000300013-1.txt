Our patient, with no personal history of interest, was diagnosed in 2006 of a transitional cell neoplasm of the bladder (pT3G3), initially treated by transurethral resection.
In the extension study liver metastases and retroperitoneal lymph nodes were detected (compatible with a T4N2M1 stage), so it was referred to our center.
Chemotherapeutic treatment is initiated with cyclosporine and gemcitabine, obtaining a partial response.
In March 2007 she presented an episode of hematuria requiring radiotherapy, after which she underwent new cycles of chemotherapy.
In December 2007, the patient developed a new episode of hematuria. An exploration was performed under anesthesia of the bladder, with an intention, during which a bladder filled with clots and an extensive tumor mass that cannot be resected.

Subsequently, the patient presents an episode of paraphimosis, followed by acute urinary retention that required permanent urethral catheterization and shortly thereafter begins with sustained penile painful swelling.

The penile examination revealed painful induration of the corpses.
A rectal examination revealed a non-suspected prostate of malignancy.
Blood tests showed normal progeny specific values of 0.67 ng/ml.
In the same act, percutaneous biopsy of the affected bodies and an attempt to drain them were performed.
Histopathological results show metastasis of transitional cell carcinoma.

The therapeutic attitude, given the conditions of the patient, has been determined by analgesic treatment and conservative measures.
Currently the patient remains admitted to our unit with progressive deterioration of his general condition.
