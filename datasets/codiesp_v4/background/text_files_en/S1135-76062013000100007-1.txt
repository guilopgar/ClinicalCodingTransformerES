A cadaver was found in the nursing home, dressed in male clothing, partially mummified and with areas of skeletonization.
The anthropological study carried out provided the following data for identification purposes:
- Gender: skull and pelvis with male morphological criteria1,2.
- Facial tears: frontal torus marking, honeycombing.
- Age: changes in pubis symphysis: Todd stage 8 corresponding to 40-45 years3.
- Satellite: physiological length of 424 mm corresponding to a 95% probability of an average height of 160 cm4.
- Dental data: ante-mortem loss of teeth 18, 36, 46, 47 and 48, post-mortem loss of teeth 14, 16, 17, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 44, 32,
- Other findings: left unilateral mega- transverse apophysis of 32 mm dimension craniosynostosis with sacrum and ilion (type II to Castellvi) and fusion deficit at the posterior sacra of S5.

The findings described above allowed a presumption of identity in the police search database.
This presumption of identity was later corroborated by digital footprints taken on the tapered fingers.
Unfortunately, we had no clinical access to the deceased, we only found evidence that the patient was a man with psychiatric disorders.
No signs of violence were found that had left their imprint in the studied skeleton.
