A five-year-old female patient, 6 months old, with a history of two episodes of UTI at 11 and 15 months of life and prophylaxis with cefadroxile up to 18 months (normal study with renal ultrasound).
I had NIP vaccines a day.
A clinical picture characterized by fever up to 39Â°C axillary, associated with chills and vomiting food.
She also reported mild headache and nonspecific abdominal pain.
He came to his office where symptomatic management was indicated.
The next day she persisted with fever and went to the emergency department, where she was feverish, with stable hemodynamics.
The segmental examination described a decrease in the pulmonary murmur to the pulmonary bases, bilateral ocular secretion and unexudated congestive pharynx.
A total of 25,890 nasopharyngeal packs were negative for leukocytes (93% segmented) and a PCR of 77 mg/L. The urine test was normal and the adenovirus pharyngeal familiar (PCR).
Two episodes of fever accompanied by peripheral vasoconstriction were observed in the emergency department, which led to suspicion of bacteraemia. Consequently, cefoxime (kg/day) was started every 6 h after taking hemocultiva.
With suspicion of UTI, an abdominal ultrasound was performed, showing renal failure with left kidney plus cortical areas with less echogenicity.
The study was complemented with a renal scintigraphy with DMSA that was compatible with an acute infectious process of the left kidney without ruling out a basal damage.
She presented with a five-day history of seizures and renal ultrasound showed no fever.
The hemocultive and urocultive finally reported negative.
The patient was discharged with fever and diagnosis of left nephronia in good condition.
He completed three weeks of treatment with cefadroxile (30 mg/kg/day), with favorable evolution.
