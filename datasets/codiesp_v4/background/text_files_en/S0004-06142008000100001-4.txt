A 68-year-old male biopsied on several occasions due to abnormal PSA but always with a negative result, so it was decided to perform a transurethral resection at the same time as a diagnosis.
Pathology of the 20 grs revealed BPH.
Two and a half years later, he presented with obstructive symptoms that led to AUR due to stenosis of 3 cms of bulbar urethra.
Dual urethroplasty was indicated.
A year later, he returns to us because he notices a package at the level and that if he squeezes it, a urinary jet is emitted.
Urethrography showed urethral diverticulum.
The surgical treatment was excision of the lateral helmets of the diverticular sac and primary reconstruction on urethral catheter.
