A 55-year-old male presented to our Department of Cardiology in November 2004.
No history of interest.
She suffered a progressive loss of visual acuity of the right eye with a central scotoma of 10 days of evolution.
The examination showed a corrected visual acuity in the RE of 0.2 and in the left eye of the unit.
Median Amsler grid revealed a central scotoma with pericentral metamorphopsias in the RE.
An eye fundus was made, and a 78D lens macular examination showed an image similar to a complete macular hole with detachment of the posterior vitreous edge associated with no subretinal fluid.
Watzke-Allen test, positive.
The eye fundus of the left eye is normal.
Subsequently, a study was performed by optical coherence tomography of the macular hole, confirming the presence of a complete macular hole of 450as horizontal diameter with a small intraretinal cyst in one margins.
OCT image does not show the separation of the posterior hyaloids, which was evident in the funduscopic examination.
1.
The patient came three weeks after the first visit and reported a significant improvement in visual acuity and central scotoma.
The best corrected visual acuity of the RE is 0.6 and in the eye fundus there is a closure of the macular hole.
Watzke-Allen test is negative.
Median study OCT confirmed spontaneous closure with a small bridge of retinal pigment epithelium and external layers of neurosensory retina on a subretinal cystic area.
At three months, the patient remains asymptomatic with visual acuity in the RE of 1 and OCT shows a complete recovery of macular morphology with a small thickening of the pigment epithelium of the retina at the foveal level.
