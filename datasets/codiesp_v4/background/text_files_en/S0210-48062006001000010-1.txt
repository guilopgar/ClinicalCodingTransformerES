A 63-year-old male with a history of moderate prostatism and an isolated episode of acute urinary retention.
Rectal examination showed smooth adenoma II/IV with intrarectal growth and ultrasound showed a homogeneous enlarged prostate.
The initial PSA is 8.09 (free PSA index: 0.13), and in a control performed at 4 months is 8.56 (free PSA index: 0.16), so transrectal biopsy is performed.
Nine cylinders of tissue from left and right transrectal biopsies of lobes were sent to our laboratory.
Histological sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin.
Immunohistochemical techniques were also performed on paraffin sections using the streptoavidin-biotin technique (Kit LASB 2 Sustem-HRP; Dako) after unmasking the citrate buffer antigen.
The following antibodies were used: Cytokeratins AE1-3 (Prediluted, Dako); S-100 (Policlonal, prediluted, Dako) and CDM681, concentration 1: LAC50-
In the biopsy material, one of the fragments obtained from the left lobe is observed as a diffuse neoplasm of small nucleus cells, non-atypical, and very large granular cytoplasm.
Granules sometimes form small rounded accumulations and are PAS positive.
With immunohistochemical techniques cellularity is negative for cytokeratins and strongly positive for CD-68 and S-100.
All this was labelled as granular cell tumor.
In the rest of the fragments of both lobes hyperplasia changes were observed without evidence of malignancy.
