An 8-day-old female neonate suffering from cephalohematema after delivery with forceps.
The Neonatology Unit of our hospital requested assessment of Plastic Surgery.
On clinical examination we observed necrotic tissue of approximately 3x4 cm in diameter in the occipital region.
1.
Serial debridements were performed at 8 and 15 days of life.
In this second intervention, we chose to continuously place a vacuum therapy system (Renasys®, Smith&Nephew®, London, UK) at 120 mmHg every 72 hours, with changes.
With this treatment we observed contraction of the original defect, requiring rotational flaps for definitive closure of the wound.
The patient was discharged on the 4 postoperative day, with no major incidents.
The last evaluation was performed 18 months after surgery, observing only a small area of alopecia rickets or a flange in the region of the neck, susceptible to new surgical interventions in the future if the patient does.
