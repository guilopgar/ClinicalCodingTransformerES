A four-year-old boy afflicted with pulsatile arthritis, pharyngeal smear negative for Streptococcus, and with the rest of the normal physical examination.
Two days before she had fever and diarrhea.
Therefore, it is suggested as a viral condition, performing symptomatic treatment.
Two days later, due to persistent liquid stools, a coprocultive test was requested that was positive for Salmonella typhimurium.
Fifteen days after the onset of symptoms, the child presents erythematous lesions and some painful, pretibial nodules in both lower extremities, with a number of 8-9, with no other signs or symptoms.
The clinical presentation was oriented as NS secondary to S. typhimurium.
We requested chest X-ray and laboratory tests with blood count, biochemistry, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (GSR), rheumatoid factor, antistreptococcal antibodies (ANA), to rule out other possible etiologies1.
The chest X-ray showed no radiological alterations and the laboratory tests were normal.
One week later the nodules disappeared, with complete healing.
