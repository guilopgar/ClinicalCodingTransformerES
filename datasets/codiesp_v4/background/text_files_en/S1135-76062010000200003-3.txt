A 34-year-old man, resident in the Delegation of the Juntas in Puerto Vallarta, was attacked by a crocodile when he decided to enter the waters of the mouth of the river A.
He submerged until the water reached the level of his neck, at that moment he observed how a crocodile resembled a trunk floating and opened his snout.
At this instant the reptile held out his left arm, turned it, and drew it to the forearm.
He swam toward the bank, repelling the crocodile's collisions, where he asked for help near a hotel in Nuevo Vallarta, Nayarit.
The victim was taken to the regional hospital of Puerto Vallarta, where she underwent reconstructive surgery of the amputated limb in her second third.
Amputated tissues deposited in a local funerary were reviewed.
Severe damage was observed in the h bone assuming radioulnar joint and radio-phonation mild. There was no presence of membrane and ligament. The condyle was adribital, and a neck fracture caused by a talar fracture.
The distal forearm and hand did not recover from the attack scene.
