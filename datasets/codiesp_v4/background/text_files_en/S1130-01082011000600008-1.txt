This is a 50-year-old male, with no family history of interest, diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism and early scleroderma in follow-up in Rheumatology and Pathology consultations.
One year before he had presented necrosis in the pulps of the fingers of the hands, so a study began.
Capillaroscopy was compatible and ANA positive (1/640), with negative anticentromere antibodies, RNP and scl-70.
Treatment was initiated with bosentan and acetylsalicylic acid.
He came to the emergency room of our hospital with melena and epistaxis of three days of evolution.
On admission she had a hemoglobin value of 8.5 mg/dl with normal platelet count, normal coagulation and a VSG of 48 mm/h.
The examination revealed multiple telangiectasias in the finger pulps, oral mucosa and perioral region.
A gastroscopy showed several small lesions (less than 5 mm) of vascular appearance in the esophageal, gastric and duodenal mucosa, without recent signs of bleeding or traces of bleeding.
At the junction, multiple telangiectasias were visualized from the anus to the cecum.
There were no melenas during admission and there was no decrease in hematocrit, so she was discharged with oral iron and folic acid supplements.
