We present the case of a 17-year-old female patient with a history of epilepsy under treatment, who consulted for presenting two fast growing tumors during the last year, located in the left arm and back.
Physical examination revealed an irregular nodule measuring 3.5 x 3 cm in diameter, located in the left arm, accompanied by erythema in the overlying skin.
At the apexification, the lesion was solid, well-defined, multilobular, mobile, and was surrounded by lax tissue.
The patient reported pain, both when compressed superficially and when performing a deep fixation of the lesion.
In addition, the patient presented another 1.8 x 1.8 cm nodule located on the dorsum, with similar appearance and findings on palpation of the arm lesion, previously described.

Pilomatrixoma was diagnosed and differential diagnosis considered dermatofibrosarcoma probands.
The ultrasound of soft tissues showed nodular, lobulated, heterogeneous tumors, with multiple calcifications, which compromised hypodermis and dermis, and mostly respected the epidermis.
It was decided to perform a surgical excision with local anesthesia of both lesions for subsequent histological study.
Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of anetodermic pilomatrixoma.
