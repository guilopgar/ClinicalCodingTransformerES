A nine-year-old patient came to our consultation for presenting an indurated lesion in the external aspect of the thigh, unique, linear, with doubtful adherence to deep planes and no other associated symptoms.
This lesion is excised and Pathological Anatomy provides the following report: “Paniculitides neutrophilic lobular predominance with high proportion of peripheral and congenital malformations.
There is massive destruction of adipocytes with extensive lipophagic granuloma, all delimited by abundant fibrous connective tissue”.
Microscopically, it refers to the existence of intracellular remains PAS+ and few Touton-type giant cells.
Inflammatory cells have common surface markers ruling out nature.
They add as possible causes 5-8:
• Self-eczematization reaction associated with infection, predominantly bacterial8.
• Juvenile deep localized scleroderma5, although neutrophilic infiltrate is usually less patent.
• Les evolutives in Weber Christian syndrome.
Pan associated with α1-antitrypsin deficiency.
