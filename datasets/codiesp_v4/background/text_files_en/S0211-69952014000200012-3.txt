A 48-year-old Caucasian male with CRF secondary to chronic interstitial nephropathy in the sinus of vesicoureteral reflux was started on hemodialysis in 1990.
He received his first kidney transplant from deceased donor in 1991, returning to dialysis in 1997 for chronic graft nephropathy.
In 1999 he received his second kidney transplant with urgent transplantectomy five months later for renal rupture due to acute rejection.
In 2005, she received her third kidney transplant from a deceased donor and returned to dialysis in January 2010 after loss of renal graft function due to chronic nephropathy.
Again, as a result of the multiple transfusions received, «non-A, non-B» hepatitis was diagnosed in 1990, subsequently confirming the positivity of HCV-RNA in type 1a.
Six months after return to dialysis, embolization of the third renal graft was performed, given the immunological risk of this patient due to a history of acute rejection, hyperimmunization and three previous transplants.
In September 2012, after determination of the IL28B C/C polymorphism and weekly erythropoiesis response (antiviral load), treatment for chronic viral hepatitis with mild fibrosis in the fibroscan was initiated with pegylated IFN α2a, 135 μg.
One year after the start of treatment, it remains undetectable and has not presented acute rejection of the non-functioning renal graft.
