We report the case of a 73-year-old female patient with a history of unilateral nephrectomy, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and treated with simvastatin (20/day), acid-base (100 mg/daydl), lithiasis by nica, 83 mg/dl).
The patient did not report any digestive symptoms, changes in the intestinal rhythm or pathological products in the stool, asthenia being the only remarkable symptom.
Physical examination was normal.
Gastroscopy showed no remarkable endoscopic abnormalities.
Antral biopsies showed mild superficial gastritis and duodenal biopsies showed no pathological findings.
A mild colitis, 2 small sessiles were visualized in the sigmoid colon without complications.
To complete the study an enteroscopy with capsule endoscopy (CE) was performed in which, surprisingly, an associated hiatal hernia was identified with associated hiatal hernia I/IV without finding other potentially bleeding lesions in the rest of the tract
The patient started treatment with antireflux measures and proton pump inhibitors with normalization of analytical parameters in 3 months.
The incidence of lesions in territories theoretically accessible to conventional endoscopy during CE examinations is unknown.
However, the existence of cases such as the one we present is not uncommon as has been demonstrated in the literature (1-4).
This means that, despite not being the priority objective of this procedure, the images obtained by CE in the esophagus, stomach and colon must be carefully reviewed by the endoscopist.
