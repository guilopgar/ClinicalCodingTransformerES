A 68-year-old woman with a history of chronic renal failure presented with a two-year history of progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids and episodes of bronchoaspiration.
The EGD suggested the presence of contractiles in the lower middle third, as well as a diverticulum in the lower right posterior face of 2.9 x 2.8 cm diameter, which was confirmed in the endoscopic study.
