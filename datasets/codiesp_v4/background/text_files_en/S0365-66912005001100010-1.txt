A 90-year-old male, operated one year and a half before cataracts that 18 months after the intervention showed a decrease in the visual acuity of unity to 0.7, with a corneal lesion of gelatinous aspect and limbal extension of 1.5 hours.
The rest of the examination was normal.
Treatment was initiated with 0.02% Mitomycin-C, 1 drop 3 times a day for 1 week (1), resuming the lesion at 1/3 of its extension.
Intraoperative exeresis of the lesion was performed with application of 0.02% Mitomycin-C on the lesion bed (2) for 2 minutes and anatomopathological study, which reported: conjunctival epithelium with mature lesions/3 affecting minimal surface.
Nuclei enlarged in the scaly cells, with loss of polarity and occasional mitosis.
No neoplasm was observed.
The follow-up for 18 months showed no recurrence, finding the limbus and cornea free of affectation.
