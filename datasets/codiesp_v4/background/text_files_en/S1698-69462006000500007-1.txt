A 19-year-old male referred to have come to his private dentist three and a half years ago for presenting a nodule in the dorsum of the tongue, with excision of the same color of the adjacent mucosa. a biopsy of the cervical lymph node was performed.

The macroscopic piece has firm consistency, irregular shape and surface, brown color 10 x 6 x 5 mm.

In the histopathological study it was possible to observe multiple pseudocystic cavities of variable size composed of cubic cells of scarce cytoplasm, convalescent nuclei with eosinophilic content, surrounded by a strand of diffuse fibrous connective tissue.
1.
With these characteristics the diagnosis of cystic carcinoma is given, being different from the previous diagnosis of canalicular adenoma, so it is decided to request the histological section of the first biopsy taken characteristics of a CAQ with borders
It was decided to carry out the recommended immunohistochemical panel, which is the following: protein S, Actin for specific smooth muscle, CALPO, CEA, Epitelial, Antylelic, MetNA, PAGF.
(7-8)
The results of these markers were: positive CEA in the cytoplasm and in the membrane of luminal cells (usually found in striated ducts of minor salivary glands), positive EMA in myoepithelial duct inter-100 is myoepithelial.
CALP was positive, confirming the presence of myoepithelial cells, also staining with Ki-67 showed scarce focal areas with approximately 15 to 20% of nuclear staining recurrence in a long-term follow-up.
