A 69-year-old male with total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y gastric adenocarcinoma poorly differentiated 12 months ago.
As adjuvant treatment she received radiotherapy and chemotherapy, because she had peritoneal implants in the histological study of the surgical specimen.
Upper endoscopy was performed for progressive dysphagia and weight loss, where there was evidence of fibrous ring in ureteral anastomosis, and a jejunal stenosis close to the anastomosis.
Biopsies were taken that were negative for malignancy.
The suspicion of local recurrence due to peritoneal carcinomatosis was established and an unrecovered expandable esophageal prosthesis of 10 cm in length was placed.
The patient died at 4 months of follow-up due to systemic tumor invasion.
