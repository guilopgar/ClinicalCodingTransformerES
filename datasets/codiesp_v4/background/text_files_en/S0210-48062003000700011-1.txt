We report the case of a 78-year-old man with a history of hypertension and chronic arthropathy, controlled in the outpatient clinic with a diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma treated with complete androgen deprivation.
The patient required a permanent bladder catheter.
It was decided to perform a deobstructive transurethral resection, during which an extensive area was observed on the mucosa of the trigone and lateral faces of the bladder with slightly solid, nodular appearance lesions.
Transurethral resection of the prostate and biopsy of the lesions described in the bladder were performed.
Anatomopathological study revealed a bladder mucosa whose surface lining epithelium was preserved.
Underlying this urothelium, there is an intense chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed exclusively of lymphoid cells that organize authentic lymphoid follicles with clear germinal centers, all corresponds to follicular diagnosis.
