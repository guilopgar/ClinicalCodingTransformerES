An 18-year-old male, with no relevant urological history, presented with an asymptomatic giant right inguinal mass with a 1-year history.
Physical examination revealed a firm mass, about 15cm, painless to palpation, with negative transfixation, and medially displaced to the right testicle.
Testicular markers (alpha fetoprotein, Beta-HCG and LDH) were negative.
The ultrasound examination showed a solid, heterogeneous lesion measuring about 19 x 17cm in diameter in the region of the cord, which did not appear to be heterogeneous.
Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging revealed a recessive and right-sided malformation displacing the testicles, which in turn had normal characteristics.
Cholesterol-abdominal-pelvic CT did not reveal lung metastases, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, or any other disease.
An expanded right inguinal incision was performed, resecting a large dependent colorful mass of the cord which displaced the testicle without it.
Surgical treatment was completed by right inguinal orchiectomy with upper cord ligation.

Histologically, it corresponded to a well differentiated cord LPS.
Having been valued by the Service of On-line and Radiotherapy the patient feels the need for chemotherapy and/or adjuvant radiotherapy, due to the low grade of the tumor and the wide area to be radiated taking into account.
Currently, 10 months after surgery, there is no tumor recurrence.
