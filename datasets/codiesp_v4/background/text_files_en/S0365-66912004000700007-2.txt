A 28-year-old woman with a diagnosis of EB in March 2002 due to vasculitis affecting both eyes, oral aphthous ulcers, erythema nodosum on the lower extremities, and superficial thromboflebitis on the left side.
Treatment was initiated with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day.
Despite treatment with 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone, it was not possible to reduce the dose of prednisone to less than 25 mg/day.
The patient refused treatment with cyclosporine and azathioprine and had eight recurrences of posterior uveitis in both eyes during 2002 (a monthly recurrence).
Given the lack of control of the clinical picture, it was decided to start treatment with PACG with a VA of 0.5 in the RE and 0.9 in the LE, and 50 mg/day of prednisone.
