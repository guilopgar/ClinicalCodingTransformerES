A 64-year-old woman operated on in our center 5 years earlier for sarcoma rim; sternectomy and reconstruction were performed with a methacrylate plate placed between the costal arches by suturing after opening holes in her
The patient came to the clinic due to a general malaise with intermittent fever in the last 4 months.
Computed tomography (CT) showed a collection of liquid material under the methacrylate plaque, compatible with empyema.
1.
We decided to intervene and remove the alloplastic material plate.
We found abundant purulent material in which an anaerobic microorganism was isolated.
The reconstruction was performed with a covered epiploic flap based on the right and left gastroepiploic vessels with a meshed skin graft.
The patient was discharged 6 days after surgery.
There was no local tumor recurrence and biopsies of the edges were negative.
The revisions are satisfactory since then, fulfilling 18 months of evolution at the time of writing this work.
