A 71-year-old man presented with abdominal pain on ultrasound, a renal mass.
A tru-cut biopsy diagnosed as mesenchymal tumor was performed.
She underwent surgery.
We received a capsule of 21x18x16 cm., 4 kg. weight, where a well-defined white tumour located in the upper pole of the kidney was recognized.
At the cut, the appearance was fasciculated, with edematous areas and small fissures.
Ten years after diagnosis the patient is asymptomatic.

Histological findings
They were similar in both cases.
It was a proliferation of fusocellular cells with areas of different densities without tapering or mitosis.
This vaguely nodular pattern occasionally presented cystic epithelial structures.
Stromal cells were positive for CD-34 and vimentin.
Ultrastructurally, the tumor presents immature mesenchymal cells.
