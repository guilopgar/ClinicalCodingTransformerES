A 27-year-old Peruvian woman from Lima consulted for multiple pruritic skin lesions on the right foot of 10 days onset.
Later, limb edema and general malaise were associated two days before the evaluation.
As a history, the patient had visited Tulum (Riviera Maya, Mexico) for two days, in which she walked barefoot on the arena and practiced diving, in addition to having suffered multiple bites.
He had returned to Lima two weeks before consulting.
On physical examination, the patient presented multiple serpiginous, sunken, erythematous, confluent lesions, one to three centimeters long and one to two millimeters thick, on the dorsum and 4° orte.
In addition, small pruritic vesicles were observed in the fingers.
A clinical diagnosis of cutaneous larva migrans was made and treatment was indicated with topical application of 6 mg/ml oral drop solution at a dose of 200 μg/kg of weight for two days and rest.
She presented an episode of fever of 38°C axillary.
The lesions began to regress on the third day after treatment.
