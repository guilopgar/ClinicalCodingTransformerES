We report the case of an 87-year-old woman with a history of ischemic heart disease, hypothyroidism and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
He came to our emergency department with colic pain in the left iliac fossa radiating to the ipsilateral thigh accompanied by nausea and constipation.
Physical examination revealed abdominal disfunction, tympanism and absence of peritalsis.
Abdominal X-rays showed dilatation of small bowel loops with air-fluid levels and absence of distal air.
A nasogastric tube was placed and management was started with intravenous hydration, without improvement.
Due to the lack of improvement, an abdominal CT scan showed a herniated obturator canal with intestinal loops inside.
The patient underwent surgery, performing a midline incision with dissection by planes, release of ileum loop, dissection of sac and placement of mesh in the hernia defect.
No complications were reported and there was no evidence of intestinal loop ischemia.
The patient was admitted to the hospital ward where her evolution was adequate, so she could be discharged home.
