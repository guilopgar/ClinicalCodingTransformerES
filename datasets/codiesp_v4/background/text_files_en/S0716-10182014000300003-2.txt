An adult over 61 years old, with a history of hypertension, had been admitted to the Neurology Department three weeks before with the diagnosis of Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA).
At home, however, the patient developed fever and, one week after admission, she was hospitalized for a second TIA.
On this occasion and given its febrile course, the patient was evaluated by the Department of Infectious Diseases.
She did not have common risk factors for developing constipation, but approximately 1.5 months earlier, she had undergone a CA due to chest pain of unknown cause.
His physical examination revealed fever of 39.7Â°C accompanied by solemn chills, loss of motor function in grade 3/5 of the upper and lower right lower extremities low systolic border, palpable liver border.

A TTE demonstrated the existence of a 12 x 6 mm freely mobile vegetation adhered to the mitral valve, together with a certain degree of mitral regurgitation.
P. aeruginosa was isolated in all hemocultives three days after inoculation.
It was found that this strain had the same antibiogram as patient 1.
Ongoing antibiotic therapy was maintained and a reduction in vegetation size was observed in an echocardiographic control.
However, on day 24 of antibiotic therapy, the patient presented signs of acute heart failure.
She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and supported with mechanical ventilation.
