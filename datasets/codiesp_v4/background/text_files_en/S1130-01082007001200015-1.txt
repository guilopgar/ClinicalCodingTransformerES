A 21-year-old male patient with a history of obesity, hypertension, mono-rhein, and ectomised arthritis four years ago.
She had a history of a tumor in the right iliac fossa with months of evolution and faster growth in recent weeks without a history of trauma.
The right iliac fossa showed an old Mc Burney incision scar.
At its lower end, in the area corresponding to the right anterior rectum, close to the inguinal area, a hard tumor appears adhered to deep planes and painful to pressure.
No other alterations of interest were observed in the examination.
An abdominal echo is performed where a lesion appears adjacent to the right anterior rectus muscle with lobulated contour of approximately 7 x 6 x 7 cm.
In the CT study, which is performed with intravenous contrast, a mass between the right anterior rectum and the oblique of about 8 cm in diameter was observed, whose structure is suggestive of corresponding sarcoma.
The possibility of fibromatosis is not ruled out.
1.
Analytical and hormonal studies were normal.
It was decided to perform a surgical intervention in which there was a large 10 x 15 cm tumor with no fascia of the greater oblique; intraoperative biopsy was reported as sarcoma.
Total tumor resection was performed by placing a polypropylene mesh.
The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day.
1.
She was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.
At present, the patient remains symptom-free, laboratory tests are normal and imaging studies show no local recurrence or distant metastases.
Pathological anatomy is informed as a soft tissue neuroendocrine tumor.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive CD99, positive enolase, positive neurofilaments and positive synaptophysin.
Negative epithelial and muscle markers.
