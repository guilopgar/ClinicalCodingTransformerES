A 43-year-old patient diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia carrying the chromodaphide in the first remission.
An adequate dose graft was identified with two compatible units in the St. Louis Blood Bank (USA) and Chile.
The patient had early recovery and the chimerism study showed that more than 95% of leukocytes came from precursors of the Chilean unit.
During the post-transplant period she presented with BK virus, asymptomatic reactivation of cytomegalovirus, pneumonia by cystis jirovei syndrome and lymphoproliferation syndrome by E. proliferative specifically in all of them.
Four years after transplantation the patient performs normal work and family activity.
