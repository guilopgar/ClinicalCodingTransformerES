We report the case of a 15-year-old male who was admitted for diarrheal stools, colic abdominal pain and loss of 8 kg. Upon admission, 23,660 leukocytes and analytical pancolitis were evidenced.
The patient had an early upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so a gastroscopy showed continued involvement of the gastric mucosa, loss of vascular pattern and folds, mucosal exudate, friability and erosions in the duodenum.
I'm sorry about that.
Pathology revealed acute cryptic cryptic abscesses and foveolar hyperplasia compatible with UC.
Helicobacter pylori infection and negativity of immunohistochemical techniques (Schiff Periodic Acid [SPA], Gram and CMV) were ruled out.
Proximal involvement of the UC was continued with intravenous corticosteroids, with good evolution and symptomatic resolution in one week.
Gastroscopy at three months was normal.
Currently, the patient is asymptomatic, with azathioprine 150 mg/24 h and desk 4 g/24 h.
