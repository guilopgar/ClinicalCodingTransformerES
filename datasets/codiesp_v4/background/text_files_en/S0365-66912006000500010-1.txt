A 30-year-old male patient, with no relevant personal history, came to the emergency department with sudden decrease of vision and central scotoma in his right eye (OD).
He reported having been looking directly and uninterestedly at the sun by the DO during the sun's ellipse of October 3 2005 for a period of 3 minutes.
On examination, the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/50 in the RE and 20/25 in the left eye (LE).
The anterior segment was within normal limits, as well as pupillary reflexes and intraocular pressure.
In funduscopy, the LE was normal and the RE showed mild alteration of the pigment epithelium (EPR) as well as a dilated lesion in the foveolar area.
Fluorescein angiography (FFA) was within normal limits, as well as visual field (Octopus-Top strategy).
The Amsler grid showed no alterations.
Examination with OCT-III revealed a clear defect in the external segment of the foveal photoreceptors, without other significant findings.
The patient was reviewed after two months, repeating the diagnostic tests already performed at the first visit.
The CMVA decreased in the right eye to 20, remaining stable in the left eye and the patient reported a clear dyschromatopsia.
The crocoded Farnsworth 25 test performed showed no alterations.
OCT also showed a defect in the external segment of the foveal photoreceptors although smaller than that performed in the first review (the defect was compared in the same OCT cut).
The remaining tests were normal.
