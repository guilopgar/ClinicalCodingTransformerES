A 22-year-old male patient, with no relevant medical history, apparently good nutritional status, oriented in space, time, place, person and self-psychic, non-smoker and without systemic changes.
The buccal examination revealed gingival recession at the level of tooth 41. Measurements were made with a millimeter periodontal probe which revealed a retraction of the gingival margin of 8 mm at the buccal level starting from the line.
Gingival recession extended apically to the mucogingival junction and lost height of the proximal periodontium. Recession classification was consistent with Miller class II (7).
Prior to the surgical intervention a scraping and smoothing of the dental organ was performed to detoxify the exposed root surface.
