A 24-year-old female patient with no relevant morbid history presented to the emergency department of our hospital in June 2005 with a 3-hour history of proton pump, characterized by moderate epigastric abdominal pain.
The patient was referred to the emergency department the following day due to persistent epigastric pain. An abdominal ultrasound showed a cystic retroperitoneal lesion.
Computed tomography (CT) revealed a well-defined 44 x 26 mm multilayer cystic mass that caudally contacted the body of the pancreas.

The patient underwent a bilateral subcostal exploratory laparotomy, finding the lesion, described in the CAT scan, closely adhered to the pancreas, so a distal anatomy of the cyst and a pancreatectomy was performed.

Pathological findings

Pancreas showed deposits and pancreatic islets with normal architecture.
Two lymph nodes were identified peripancreatic without alterations.
The histological diagnosis was compatible with a retroperitoneal bronchogenic cyst.
The patient was discharged on postoperative day 10.
