A 38-year-old woman was referred from a regional hospital to our center for evaluation of a NO tumor.
His medical history showed a progressive decrease in VA in the last year, which disappeared in the last 2 or 3 months.
In July 2005, her VA was 0.7, in August 0.5, in October 0.1, in November of account fingers at one meter and in December of 2005 when she was referred she had amaurosis in absolute afferent pupil and defect.
The exophthalmos does not reflect pathologies between AO.
From the first time the patient was studied, she presented papilledema in the RE with normal OI.
CT scans were informed of optic nerves as the right nerve was slightly thickened in relation to the contralateral nerve.
An orbital nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was performed in December 2005. A diffuse thickening of the right intracranial conduit extending to the right dural sheath was reported in December 2005, with absence of any enhancement of the nerve itself.
After explaining the therapeutic options, the patient rejects any type of action and currently follows periodic reviews.
