A 30-year-old woman diagnosed with WD at 12 years of age with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension, without neuropsychiatric involvement.
Treatment with D-penicillosis (350 mg/8 hours.) since diagnosis.
She consulted due to loss of skin flexibility, appearance of whitish papules and redundant skin in the cervical and axillary region.
Biopsy was compatible with an elastic pseudopseudoxantoma (PPXE) secondary to treatment with D-penicillosis.
This finding was suspended and zinc acetate was started (50 mg/8 hours.o.).
Likewise, radiological and echocardiographic examinations were performed to rule out elastic tissue involvement at another level, the study being negative.
