A 21-year-old woman with a rural residence in the IX region until she was 15 years old.
The patient was evaluated for one month with dorsalgia, decreased strength of the lower limbs, constipation, and difficulty sleeping.
On examination, anesthesia was found with level D7 distally, exhaled osteotendinous flaps, bilateral positive Babinski sign. An anterior spinal syndrome with level D7 was suggested.
The dorsal spine x-ray showed destruction of D3-D4 rights.
A CT scan of the dorsal spine showed multiple cystic vertebral lesions at level D3-D4 and a myelography with significant compression of the dural and medullary sac with obliteration of the subarachnoid space D4 upper spinal cord involvement.
1.
D3-D4 hemilaminectomy and cyst excision were performed.
Histopathological study concluded bone hydatid disease.
The blood count showed no alterations and the study with abdominal ultrasound and chest X-ray showed no cysts in liver or lung, completing the patient three cycles of albendazole with good clinical evolution and progressive remission of neurological symptoms.
She was reoperated on four occasions (2, 3, 12 and 13 years later) for presenting severe paraparesis and sphincter incontinence with imaging studies (CT and MRI of the dorsal spine) that showed invasion of the spinal and expanding sac.
Surgical debridement was performed with hypertonic solution and descrompressive laminectomy with resection of vertebral bodies and arthrodesis between D1-D5 completing six cycles of albendazole.
He is currently in good condition, without neurological deficit.
