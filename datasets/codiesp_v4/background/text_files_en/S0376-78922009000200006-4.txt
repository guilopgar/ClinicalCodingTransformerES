A 67-year-old woman was designed for a zygomatic bone marrow flap after complete resection of basal cell carcinoma in the left internal canthus after frozen section biopsy and verification of healthy limits.
It can be noted in the images that the resection reaches close to the inner edge of the left eyebrow, and yet the defect is easily covered by the zigo hair flap without any retraction.
