A 72-year-old male presented with voiding syndrome in the minutes following the first administration of gemcitabine in the bladder, with severe local pain, pollakiuria, dysuria and hematuria (grade 1)5.
Urinocultiva was negative.
The symptoms improved slowly after weeks with anticholinergic treatment.
Cystoscopy at 2 weeks showed significant mucosal edema and hyperplasia of the epithelium at the bladder bottom.
A new TUR was performed, and the anatomopathological analysis revealed sub-focal fibrosis with nonspecific cyst-specific foci, compatible with chemical cystoepithelial, which led to the decision to discontinue treatment.
