A 59-year-old woman diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma in the left eyebrow that presented a 7x5 cm defect after tumor resection.
We performed a temporal artery island flap for complete reconstruction of the eyebrow with hair skin.
Laser depilation was then performed to achieve symmetry with the contralateral eyebrow.
