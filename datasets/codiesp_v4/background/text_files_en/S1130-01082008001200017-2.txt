A 55-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis due to hepatitis C was admitted due to jaundice, abdominal pain and constitutional syndrome of three months duration.
Laboratory tests showed elevated bilirubin and stasis enzymes.
CT showed multiple lesions in both liver lobes consistent with metastases versus multicentric hepatocellular carcinoma with a nodular image in the spleen.
Two weeks after admission he died due to liver failure with an autopsy compatible with HSA with splenic metastasis.
