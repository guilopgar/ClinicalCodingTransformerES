A 34-year-old patient was admitted for the study of recurrent low flow priapism, with no relevant pathological history.
It was not possible to demonstrate an etiology associated with the disease.
Due to the good response to intracerebral administration of 2-10 mg metoxamine, with excellent tolerance but recurrence of the drug, the patient was referred for home self-injection with local anesthetic.
It was necessary to use it several times for approximately one month; then the patient has preserved erectile function without problems.
