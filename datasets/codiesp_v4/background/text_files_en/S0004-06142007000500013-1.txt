A 24-year-old patient with no history of interest due to mild progressive left testicular pain, with no other relevant data.
Testicular Doppler ultrasound showed no alterations in the right test.
On the left side there is a marked decrease in testicular size, with patched hypoechoic echostructure, without evident masses and severe dilation of the venous plexus, with tortuous vessels and a significant intratesticular component.
There is a decrease in the number of vessels in hypoechoic areas (color Doppler ultrasound, "angiopower" - energy mode-) and a spontaneous flow in the varicose vessels, which increases with maneuvers of Valsalva.
The rest of the ultrasound study of vesicoprosy and renal arteries, as well as CT scan of the pelvic non-muscle region, are normal.
