A 27-year-old woman with multiple visits to the emergency department and hospital admissions for episodes of abdominal pain that resolved spontaneously and with multiple complementary examinations (abdominal CT, magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopies, capsule) in which no pathology was detected.
Magnetic enteroresonance is performed in one of these patients. At least three intussusceptions are observed and there is no evidence of underlying lesion.
All events were resolved conservatively.
The author insists on abandoning the habit of singing and ceasing to present these episodes during about 9 months in those who do not consume cannabis (submissive episodes presented regular consumption).
Coinciding with the recidivism in cannabis use, she must go to the emergency room for a new spontaneous episode of voluntary withdrawal, although complementary tests were not requested to demonstrate invaginations at this admission.
