Female patient, 73 years old.
No relevant morbid history.
She had not undergone abdominal surgery and had not recently presented any acute abdominal condition or trauma to the area.
It was characterized by vague digestive discomfort, mainly dyspeptic, with flatulence, disorientation and fluctuating tendency to estitiquez.
Physical examination revealed a patient in good general condition with pink mucous membranes and good nutritional status.
Abdominal evaluation ruled out visceromegaly and the presence of masses.
No abdominal murmurs, with good inguinal and distal pulses.
Blood count and biochemical tests were requested, along with an abdominal ultrasound examination (US).
The results showed absence of anemia and normal hepatic and renal functions.
US showed a cystic lesion of 2.3 cm in diameter in relation to the body of the pancreas.
This last examination led to computed axial tomography (CAT) of the abdomen, which confirmed the presence of a 2.5 cm diameter splenic artery aneurysm at the level of the pancreas-carpal region.
1.
Endovascular treatment was programmed, performing a right femoral exploration according to Seldinger's method with coaxial technique, and embolization using metallic coils until complete occlusion of the cavity.
1.
A follow-up CT scan performed 30 days later showed the aneurysmal segment of the splenic artery with distal permeability.
No focal ischemic lesions were seen in the parenchyma of the spleen.
One year after the procedure, the patient is in good condition and without symptoms.
