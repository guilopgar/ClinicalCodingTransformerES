A 74 year old woman on hemodialysis since 2010 through a right humerocefic fistula.
The patient has pain and increased volume of the right upper limb (RLJ) with functional impotence and AVF malfunction.
Phlebography of the MSD showed subclavian vein obstruction.
An attempt is made to make the stent viable without achieving it.
Establishing progressive symptoms, it was decided to place a jugular central venous catheter and close the AVF.
An echo-guided thrombotic puncture was performed in the ceftazidime a about 4-5 cm of the AVF, proving its thrombosis.
At the 7-day follow-up visit, the patient reported improvement of pain, although she maintained edema.
A control Doppler ultrasound showed patency of the first centimeters of the cephalea, with the rest of the thrombosed vein being attached to the axillary vein.
A new proximal puncture was performed, with thrombosis of the entire ceftazidime.
The swelling disappeared within 7 days.
A control Doppler ultrasound showed occlusion of the cefa and permeability of the brachial artery.
