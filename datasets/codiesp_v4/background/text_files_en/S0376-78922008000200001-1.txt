We report the case of a 37-year-old female patient referred to our department from another hospital due to a loss of substance on the back of her left hand for two days after suffering a traffic accident.
On examination, a 7 x 7 cm diameter skin loss was observed on the back of the left hand, with very contiguous borders that exceeded the metaphalangic joint of the second.
We also found an exposure of the extensor tendons of the 2nd and 3rd fingers with rupture of the extensor of the 2nd finger, as well as exposure of the dorsal interosseous muscles of the 1st and 2nd fingers.
There was no neurovascular deficit or associated fractures.

After a first cure performed on admission, with removal of devitalized tissues and repair of the extensor tendon of the second finger, we propose how to perform the coverage of the defect, opting for a reconstruction using an interpatent flap.
The reasons for this choice are presented in the Discussion section.
