The authors present a case of a 78-year-old man, with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis, referred for capsule endoscopy because of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, requiring blood transfusion gastroscopy or colitis.
A capsule PillCam SB (Given Imaging, Israel) was used.
The capsule ingestion was witnessed by a physician.
The patient had difficulty initiating the medication with several unsuccessful attempts.
Suddenly he developed a vigorous cough crisis that reverted spontaneously after a few minutes without recurrence of respiratory symptoms.
The data recorder was recovered exhausted the duration of the battery (9 h) and the examination was interpreted the following day.
It was found that after a period of 75 seconds in the oral cavity, the capsule moved into the airway, with the typical annular structure of the trachea and bifurcation of the main bronchi.
After about two minutes of inactivity, the capsule transmits images of the esophagus.
Once in the digestive tract, the capsule follows the usual course, reaching the cecum after 7 h 28 m.
We identified abundant angiodysplasias in the small intestine, probable cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in this patient.
