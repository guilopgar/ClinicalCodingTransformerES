A 73-year-old man with an incidental radiological finding of a pancreatic cystic lesion.
Physical examination and blood tests were normal except for increased blood levels of CA19-9 and CEA.
Abdominal CT (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a multilocular lesion of 5.2 cm in diameter in the body-column of pancreas with high suspicion of malignancy (cystoadenoma vs. cystadenocarcinoma).
Pancreatectomy was performed including distal tumor mass. The resection margin that was disease free was analyzed intraoperatively.
The definitive histopathological diagnosis was as follows: polilobulated solid-white cyst, well-defined crystalline cyst, occupied by abundant amorphous and granular material corresponding to corneal scams, superficial scaly cholesterol, proteinaceous material
Taped internally by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium without atypia below which lymphoid tissue with follicular aggregates is found with germinal centers diagnostic of PFLE Q.
