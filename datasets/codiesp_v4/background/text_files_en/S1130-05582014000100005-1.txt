An incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia and the study reported a diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma.
In a second surgical time, resection of the lesion with wide safety margins was performed and lingual repair and primary closure of the defect was performed.
The surgical specimen was sent for histological and immunohistochemical evaluation and the diagnosis of low-grade leiomyosarcoma with tumor-free margins was confirmed.
Histopathological examination showed a high number of spinous cells and smooth muscle cells, as well as immunoreactivity for vicentine and alpha actin smooth muscle, negative for pankeratin, as well as for desmin and CD34.
