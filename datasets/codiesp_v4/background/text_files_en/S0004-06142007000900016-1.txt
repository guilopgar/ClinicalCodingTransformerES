A 33-year-old patient came to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain and fever.
Laboratory tests are normal and the clinical examination is normal.
Abdominal ultrasound showed absence of left kidney hypertrophy with right hypertrophy.
The ultrasound examination of the pelvis showed both seminal vesicles with a size of 2.5 centimeters with globuleous aspect.
Subsequently, an intravenous urography was performed, confirming the absence of left kidney with enlarged right kidney without signs of dilatation of the excretory system.
The bladder shows a normal appearance with insertion of the right lobed.
Abdominal CT scan was performed to evaluate the pelvic cystic image seen on ultrasound, confirming an increase in size of the seminal vesicle on the left side with an adjacent ovoid image with density of soft parts in 5.5 cm.

A high aortic bifurcation was identified at L1 level, with a very lateralized left iliac branch and a right iliac branch with morphology and location similar to the aorta.
The vena cava has a bifurcation at the same level with a left iliac theorist that lateralizes in the same way as the artery and a right iliac theorist with morphology of the vena cava that later bifurcates into two vessels in the normal right vena cava.

The examination was completed with MRI given the high density of the pelvic lesion which reveals a polylobulated cystic mass with tubuliform images that drain into the prostate gland which confirms the diagnosis of seminal vesicle cyst.
