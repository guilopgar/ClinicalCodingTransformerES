We report the case of a 91-year-old male with anticoagulated atrial fibrillation with acenocoumarol who presented with hemodynamic instability associated with anemization of 5 g hemoglobin and rectal bleeding.
Urgent gastroscopy showed a diverticulum with a non-ulcerated vascular lesion inside the second duodenal portion, with active drooling point suggestive of Dieulafoy's lesion.
Three clips were placed and sclerosis was performed with etoxyclerol, showing hemostasis.
The patient did not present new bleeding data.
