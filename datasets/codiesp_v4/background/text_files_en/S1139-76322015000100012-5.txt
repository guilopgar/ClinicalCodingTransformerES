A three-year-old male presented with perianal erythema that did not respond to treatment with hydrophilic cream, discomfort at defecation, and pain that resolved by itching at night.
The examination showed erythema in the anal region compatible with perianal colitis.
Rectal smears were collected, being the rapid detection test of positive Streptococcus and starting treatment with oral penicillin and topical mupirocin for ten days.
Eight days later, a topical corticoid (hidroticona acetate), with a satisfactory evolution, should be added.
The culture showed growth of GABHS sensitive to penicillin.
