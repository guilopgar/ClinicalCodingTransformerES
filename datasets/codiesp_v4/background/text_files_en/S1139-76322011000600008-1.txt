When analyzing the family history, we know that the mother had presented a surgical wound at the time of delivery, whose culture was positive for MRSA with the same antibiogram as that found in the child in the SCC, which is caused by vertical transmission.
After conducting these investigations, a sample of the child's EAC is taken again, being again positive for MRSA, whose antibiogram is shown in Table 1.
Since this second culture is sensitive to ciprofloxacin, local treatment with this quinolone was performed and the control culture was negative.
