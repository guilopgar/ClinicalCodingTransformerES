We report the case of an 83-year-old man with hepatitis B with dyspnea and lower limb edema.
The TTE showed a right ventricle (RV) dyskinetic and a mass in the right atrium (RA) that did not prolapse toward the RV, with irregular edges.
The cardiac newborn showed a heterogeneous AD mass from the inferior vena cava (IVC) of 60 x 30 mm, without collapse or compromise RV filling, with attached component.
CT showed a solid nodule of 13 mm in the right lower lobe of the lung with contrast enhancement, suggestive of metastasis and zyrotic liver with a heterogeneous mass ill-defined in segment VII, with loss of planes with intrahepatic vena cava and low extension to the rest of the right heart space.
AFP was above 2,000 mcg/ml.
