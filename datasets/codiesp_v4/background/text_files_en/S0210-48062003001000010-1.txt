A 68-year-old male patient, with no relevant personal history, presented with a mild prostatic syndrome with a IPSS score of 10 and PSA of 0.91.
Physical examination revealed rectal adenoma grade 1, and a mass in the right hemicrotum of 2 cm, hard to explore, not attached to deep planes, whitish and painless.
The patient reported more than 10 years of evolution and required surgery due to aesthetic problems.
The mass was excised under local anesthesia without incidents.
Macroscopically, the mass was whitish and firm in color with a size of 1.7 cm. The cut surface showed a solid, round-shaped lesion.
Microscopically, a relatively well-defined, non-encapsulated mesenchymal neoformation is described, consisting of bundles of 68 muscular strains showing marked cytoplasmic positivity with actin CD, focal desmin with a focal desmin
Cytological atypia was not observed.
Mitotic activity was very low (0.5 mitosis per 50 HPF), but not areas of hemorrhage or necrosis.
The diagnosis was leiomyoma and adenocarcinoma.
After two years of evolution there is no evidence of local recurrence.
