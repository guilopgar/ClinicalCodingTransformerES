A 72-year-old woman with cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Child-Pugh B was diagnosed in 2004.
Established in 2008 at Cl√≠nica Santa Maria when she was hospitalized for ascites; a 3 cm hepatocarcinoma was diagnosed through an abdominal scanner. Radiofrequency therapy was performed.
He was then admitted several times due to encephalopathy grade II and anemia with hematocrit of 24%.
A first upper endoscopy (UED) showed a watermelon-stomach VAS managed with APC, then a new UGE was performed confirming the VAS, performing antral ligation due to poor endoscopic response.
ADD was repeated several months later, showing significant improvement in VAS, with a second ligation session.
In subsequent endoscopies there was no evidence of VAS.
The patient died in April 2011 from pulmonary sepsis.
