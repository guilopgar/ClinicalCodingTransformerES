We report the case of a 44-year-old male, with no history of interest, who consulted for epigastric pain and nausea for several months.
A gastroscopy showed a tumor in the anterior aspect of the antrum, 3 cm in diameter, soft to tacto and with superficial focal erosion.
With these findings it was decided to perform a laparoscopic partial gastrectomy.
In the antrectomy specimen, a rounded, well-defined, non-encapsulated tumor of 3 cm in diameter was described at the cut.
The sections showed a solid proliferation of round cells in the submucosa, with well-defined limits, small, uniform nuclei, with delicate chromatin, without atypia or mitotic activity.
The tumor also showed prominent dilated hemangiopericytoid vessels.
The immunohistochemical study showed diffuse positivity with smooth muscle actin and focally with synaptophysin.
S100 protein, cKIT (CD117) and chromogranin staining were negative.
