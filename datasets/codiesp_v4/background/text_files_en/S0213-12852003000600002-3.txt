A 54-year-old woman presented with mild but constant discomfort for 11 months on the right side of her face, sensitive to cold and heat, and sometimes did not let her sleep.
The pain has had variable aspect so to rule out various pathologies had to go through the otorhinolaryngologist, the internist doctor, the psychiatrist, the neurologist (who was also treated) and the dentists on two occasions.
When she comes to our consultation after 11 months, pain is more located in the right lower arch.
In the inspection and in the radiographic examination nothing special was appreciated.
An antibiotic (oxylicine 500 mg/ac. clavulan 125 mg) and an antidiabetic agent (ibuprofen 600 mg) were recommended, but the improvement was transient.
Five months later she came to consultation again with mesiodistal fracture of the right lower second molar.
The extraction of this tooth ended with the pain she had had for 16 months.
