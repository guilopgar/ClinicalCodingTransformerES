A 44-year-old male who began haemodialysis for the age of 20 years due to a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis due to left radiocefaction AVF.
During the course of his disease he received two renal transplants.
In 1996 a new radiocefic AVF was performed on the contralateral limb due to previous thrombosis.
In 2003, a true asymptomatic AHA of 6 cm in diameter was detected, confirmed by arteriography.
Aneurysmal resection and interposition of the internal saphenous vein extracted from the left lower limb were performed.
Two years later, an aneurysmal dilatation of 4.5 cm of the venous graft was detected, repaired by interposition of PTFE prosthesis.
During follow-up no other complications were detected, and death in 2009 was due to metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
