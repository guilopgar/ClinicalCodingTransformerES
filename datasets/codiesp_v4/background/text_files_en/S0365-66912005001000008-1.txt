A 10-year-old male with no family or personal history of interest.
In May 2001, the patient presented with painless loss of vision in the right eye (RE) for three months.
She reported a fixed spot in the temporal area of the right visual field that prevented her from seeing associated with photopsies.
The maximum visual acuity in the RE was 0.3 and 1 in the left eye (LE).
In June 2001 the scotoma progressed, affecting the fixation with vision in RE of 0.15 and 1 in OI.
Anterior biomicroscopic examination and intrinsic motility were normal in both eyes.
The eye fundus in May 2001 was normal, only in February 2005 a limited area of pigment epithelium was detected in the RE corresponding to the scotoma.
In OI, electroretinogram (ERG) had normal wave amplitude and latency potentials during the 4 years of follow-up, in OD as early as July 2001, no potential could be detected.
Brain-orbital MRI and diffusion-perfusion MRI were normal.
The pediatric examination did not detect any systemic abnormality, and the serological and immunological study was normal during the 4 years of follow-up.
