Female, 51 years old.
Fifteen years before admission, a cervical cancer was treated with radiotherapy.
A control for hypertension found bilateral lower limb edema, elevated creatinine, bilateral hydronephrosis, hypofunction of the left kidney and a retroperitoneal mass.
Biopsy was not performed.
Ureteral catheters were installed and creatinine normalized.
In the following 35 months ureteral catheters were changed regularly and renal function remained normal, with no evidence of recurrence of cervical cancer.
