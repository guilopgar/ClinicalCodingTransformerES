A 63-year-old male presented with a temporary loss of peripheral vision that attributed to his right eye (OD).
His past medical history included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperuricemia and smoking.
Visual acuity was 0.6 in the right eye and 0.9 in the left eye and pupil motility were normal.
Median confrontation campimetry showed a right peripheral defect in each eye.
In the anterior segment only an incipient bilateral cataract, more pronounced in RE, was pointed out.
Eye tensions were normal and no abnormalities were detected in both eyebrows.
Neurological examination was normal.
A 24-2 standard SITA (Humphrey Analyzer) campimetry was performed, and only a slight decrease in mean sensitivity was observed in the RE.
In a peripheral threshold test 60-4, SITA strategy, a decrease in the sensitivity of the right eye was detected in the right eye nonspecific peripheral defects caused by a peripheral defect located outside the right eye corticonuclear cataract, but in the right eye central defects.
A standard kinetic strategy 30 was also performed in both eyes fixed with Humphrey analyzer. Retraction of the temporal visual field of RE and nasal field of OI outside 50o was detected.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed the presence of marked cortical retraction with ventricular dilatation and small lacunar infarctions in the brain axis.
A small infarction located in the calcarine fissure was observed in axial sections, with respect to almost the entire occipital cortex.
