We report the case of a 72-year-old patient with severe heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and chronic renal failure.
The patient presented with erythematous, hard and non-painful tumor measuring about 2 cm subcutaneously. The area was removed.
The pathological study reported tissue compatible with subcutaneous metastasis of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of biliary origin.
Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a central hepatic lesion compatible with hiliar cholangiocarcinoma or Klatskin tumor.
Given the baseline situation palliative treatment was established.
