A 29-year-old male patient presented with an emergency consultation due to an increase in left atrial volume due to nasal sound (Valsalva maneuver).
This same morning he had suffered a fall from height hitting the left side of the nose at the level of his own bones, after which he had mild self-limiting epistaxis.
Pathological examination revealed visual acuity 20/20 in each eye, normal pupillary reflexes and preserved ocular motility, without edema or conjunctival hyperemia, only mild ecchymosis in the medial region of the left hemisphere increase accompanied by
Orbital bone frame and nasal pyramid were painless.
Vital signs were normal.
The craniofacial radiological study confirmed the presence of subcutaneous and orbital emphysema, associated with a fracture of the papyraceous lamina of the ipsilateral ethmoid.
The patient was hospitalized and observed for 24 h, then discharged with the precaution of avoiding maneuvers that could increase upper airway pressure for two weeks.
Emphysema resolved spontaneously within 5 days and during the following two weeks the patient did not develop complications.
