A 32-year-old man, brother of the former, who came for review.
Established hemeralopia since he was aware of it and, in recent times, slight photodysphoria and slight decrease in visual acuity.
Vision is 1.0 in both eyes; both the eye fundus and angiography are similar to their brother, although with fewer macular and PRS alterations.
A central stoma appears in the campimetry.
We performed two non-standardized electrophysiological studies consisting of a baseline first electroretinogram (ERG) and a second one performed at 180 minutes of adaptation to darkness.
In both cases, basal ganglia shows a clear decrease in the amplitude of all waves.
After adaptation to darkness, the first case showed a tendency to normalize the flash and scotopic tissue, without changing neither the flicker nor the phototopic.
In the second case, adaptation to darkness normalizes waves, including the study of cones that remain at the lower limit of normality for their age.
