A 72-year-old patient with a history of gastric ulcus, insulinized type 2 diabetes mellitus, stable angina, hypertension, dyslipidemia and ischemic stroke with residual sequel in the right hand.
Usual treatment with clopidogrel, carvedilol, transdermal nitroglycerin, atorvastatin and corticosteroids.
Consultation in February 2005 for mass in the right iliac fossa.
On gynecological examination, she presents a lesion that seems to depend on the uterus.
In March 2005, a hysterectomy and double adnexectomy were performed, together with resection of the final third of the ileum, identifying a fibrous mass adhered to it.
Pathological anatomy: atrophic endometrium, chronic follicular cervicitis; ileal gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) of 8 cm in size, with 2-3morphous metastases per 50 high epithelial fields, focal cellular necrosis plekit.
The patient was referred to an outpatient physician's office where complete laboratory study was requested: hemoglobin 1 small extension/dl, with normal parameters other than normal; computed tomography scan (CTlv), bone metastases, adrenal nodule negative; pelvic abscess.
In October, a positron emission tomography (PET) was requested, which revealed the presence of a pathological deposit of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) at the level of the right iliac fossa, located on the right iliac vein.
These findings were treated with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg/day.
Tolerance to this treatment has been adequate.
In the new reassessment study, three months after the beginning of treatment, the right adrenal nodule persists, with no changes in size or appearance, and PET does not reveal the presence of any residual lesion.
