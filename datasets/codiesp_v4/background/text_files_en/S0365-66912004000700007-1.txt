A 24-year-old woman diagnosed with BE in 1996 after a bilateral vasculitis sprout, erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and a history of recurrent oral aphthous ulcers.

After several relapses of vasculitis, the azathioprine was fixed and panretinal photocoagulation was performed in both eyes due to significant peripheral ischemia.
