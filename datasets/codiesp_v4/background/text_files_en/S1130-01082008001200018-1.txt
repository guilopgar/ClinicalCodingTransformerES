A 61-year-old male, with no relevant past medical history, with nonspecific symptoms of abdominal pain, increased abdominal perimeter and constitutional syndrome.
The patient was operated on in another emergency center with suspicion of fungal infection and was diagnosed with pseudomyxoma, performing biopsies exclusively and referring him to our attention.
Although the disease affected all abdominal regions and the patient had a peritoneal carcinomatosis rate of 32, according to Sunker's classification (4), complete cystectomy was performed by cystectomy and minor peritoneal resection with curative intent.
Treatment of possible residual microscopic disease was completed with QIIH with mitomycin C at 12 mg/m2 dissolved in 1.5 l of peritoneal dialysis solution of dianeal at 0.33% continuous colic at 42 oC.
During his stay in the intensive care unit, he received PPK on days 1 to 5 of the immediate postoperative period with 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 in 1.5 l of 5% glucose for 23 hours.
The postoperative course was satisfactory with a 19-day stay without complications.
The patient remains alive and disease free more than 10 years later, having suffered a stroke due to hypertension, with residual hemiplegia.
