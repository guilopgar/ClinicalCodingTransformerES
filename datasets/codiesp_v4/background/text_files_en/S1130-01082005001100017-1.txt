A 64-year-old male with a history of old TBC and ex-smoker came to the emergency room for severe pain in the left hemiabdomen of sudden onset, accompanied by nausea and vomiting in coffee grounds.
On physical examination, the patient was hemodynamically stable, with a painful abdomen.
Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis of 27,800/L with neutrophilia of 83.2% and hemoglobin of 8.3 g/L, rest without interest.
A chest X-ray revealed a right pleural effusion. An abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogeneous tumor in the left hypochondrium between the spleen and the kidney suggestive of hematoma.
Abdominal CT confirmed the existence of left retroperitoneal hematoma suggestive of a splenic artery aneurysm of a bleeding adrenal tumor.
