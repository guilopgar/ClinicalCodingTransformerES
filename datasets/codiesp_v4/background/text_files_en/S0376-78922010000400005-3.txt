An 80-year-old male patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with squamous cell carcinoma of the scalp.
Local tumor without affecting the dura.
Excision of the lesion and periosteal flap necrosis were performed.
It was then decided to place a RenasysÂ® therapy system at -50 mm Hg.
After 3 weeks of treatment, reduction of the wound diameter and granulation on the dura were observed.
Thereafter, the lesion was closed with a triple flap consisting of silicones.
