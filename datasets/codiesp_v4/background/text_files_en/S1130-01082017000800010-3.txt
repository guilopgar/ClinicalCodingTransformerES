We report the case of a 60-year-old woman diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis with seizures and varices due to portal hypertension who was studied as atopic for liver transplantation.
On ultrasound, a dilatation of the left bile duct with a bloody appearance was striking.
CT scan showed dilation of the left bile duct and the existence of a 2 cm image interpreted as a possible hepatocarcinoma.
The diagnosis of terminal liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma is included in the waiting list for transplantation.
After one month on the waiting list a liver transplant of cadaver was performed using the technique of vena cava preservation (piggy-back).
The transplant and postoperative course were uneventful.
Histological analysis of the specimen showed an invasive intraductal papillary cholangiocarcinoma type on extensive papillomatosis of the bile duct, in addition to macronodular liver cirrhosis compatible with autoimmune origin.
She does not receive adjuvant therapy but adapts to treatment receiving mTOR inhibitors.
Currently the patient has no sign of tumor recurrence.
