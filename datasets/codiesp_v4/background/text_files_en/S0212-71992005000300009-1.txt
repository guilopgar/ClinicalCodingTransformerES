Despite an active search for the patient, it could not be treated for not attending control.
On examination performed on admission, a cachectic patient with axillary temperature of 38.2oC, RR 25x, TA 121/61 stood out.

Blood tests revealed: 4,310 white blood cells (3,060 neutrophils, 300 lymphocytes, 780 monocytes), to 22%, Hbukocytes, Hbukdl, ASTuk03 mg/dl, platelets â‰¥ 1,67 mmol/l
GAB: pH 7.5, HCO3 24.2, pO2 55 mmHg, pCO2 30.9 mmHg, SO2 87%.
