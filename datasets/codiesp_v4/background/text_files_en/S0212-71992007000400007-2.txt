A 24-year-old woman with no relevant past medical history presented with fever and colic abdominal pain.
Three months before admission, the patient presented with symptoms of cough and odynophagia treated with amoxicillin, with no improvement.
Since then, she has presented daily fever, of vespertine origin, 38-39Â° C, predominantly with acetaminophen, asthenia and, intermittently, mesogastric colic pain, which is not related to constipation.
Physical examination revealed bilateral submandibular adenopathies of 1 cm. round and homogeneous hepatomegaly of one finger.
Analytical data: Hb 11,6, leukocyte count with monocytosis (19%), VSG 47 PCR 58, IgA < 6,34.
Serology for CMV, IgM VCA and HIV were negative, with anti-VCA IgG positive.
Abdominal ultrasound revealed mild hepatomegaly homogeneous.
In the gastrointestinal transit, the ileum showed a mucus in a pedal, ulcerative colitis and loop separation.
Aphthous ulcers appear in the descending colon.
Histological findings, which show multiple ulcerations and pseudopolyps, are compatible with Crohn's disease.
