A 59-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, uterine curettage, arthrosis and cataract surgery.
The patient is studied for nonspecific abdominal pain, which is located in the epigastrium, continuous type of 5-6 months of evolution, of such intensity that goes several times to the emergency service.
The patient is referred to the surgery service and an abdominal ultrasound is performed in which a liver of normal size appears, appearing in the left liver lobe an LOE of solid characteristics, hyperechorgenic discreetly heterogeneous 3x4 cm hepatic hemangioma.
Needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) reveals a result of inconclusive material.
Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the liver revealed a solid focal hepatic lesion in segment III, approximately 4 cm in anteroposterior diameter, with a signal pattern suggesting an important intratumoral fatty component. These findings are compatible with an angiomyoma.
Once the diagnosis was made and given the symptoms of the patient it was decided to perform a surgical intervention, so we performed a segmental hepatectomy, specifically segment III.
The intervention was uneventful and the patient had a good postoperative evolution and was discharged home one week after the intervention.
The anatomopathological result of the specimen was described as angiomyolipoma, confirmed by actin, desmin, HM45 and S 100 techniques.
The patient is still under review in the clinic, and to date, 1 year after the intervention, has evolved well, has not presented any symptoms or signs of recurrence.
