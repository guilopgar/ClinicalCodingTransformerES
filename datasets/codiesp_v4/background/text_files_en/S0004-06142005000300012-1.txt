A 73-year-old woman, with no personal history of interest, who was discovered to have a left renal mass on ultrasound due to colic pain in the left renal fossa.
A subsequent CT scan revealed a large left renal mass compatible with hypernephroma with thrombosis of the left renal vein and partial thrombosis of the inferior vena cava, also extending to the left ovarian vein.
1.
MRI was performed with the purpose of finding more information about the thrombus in the inferior vena cava, confirming the existence of pathological vogue regional tumor thrombus and not finding the 7x5 adenox6 cm in the left kidney with thrombosis of the left renal vein and small vena cava.
1.
At no time during the time elapsed between these two imaging studies, the patient reported a design, hemoptysis or other clinic suggestive of thrombus detachment from the vena cava.
Likewise, no treatment was initiated that could dissolve the thrombus.
A new abdominal CT was performed to confirm the MRI findings, reporting this as a large left renal mass compatible with hypernephroma without the presence of renal vein or vena cava thrombosis, present in previous studies.
1.
In the bone scintigraphy with Tc99m-MDP, no pathological bone accumulation was observed.
Left radical nephrectomy was performed showing as an intraoperative finding a doubtful thrombus of the distal renal vein, so the vein was cleared until it crossed with the aorta, checking its total permeability at this level.
The diagnosis of nephrectomy piece was clear cell carcinoma (Fuhrman grade III), with resection margins at the ureter, artery and renal vein tumor free.
