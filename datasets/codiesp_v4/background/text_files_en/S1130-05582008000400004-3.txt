At the age of 40 years old, this patient complained of pain in the right hand and in the middle third of the left pamphlet.
Cystic lesions were found in these locations and in one rib and in the right mandibular ramus.

The patient was aware of the existence of his mandibular lesion since the age of 23, when a biopsy confirmed his benignity.
Since then, he had barely grown and he had not sought treatment.
Three years earlier, she suffered a pathological patellar fracture, which was treated in another hospital.
The cystic lesion of the right hand was diagnosed by biopsy as osteoclastoma.
The presence of multiple lesions was attributed to polyostotic fibrous dysplasia.
The following year, the patient suffered a new pathological fracture of the left and several episodes of hematuria.
During the evaluation of hematuria, high blood levels of calcium and parathormone were found, as well as cysts of the renal cortex.

In 1989, he underwent hemithyroidectomy and an adenoma of the right lower parathyroid was resected.
Since then, calcium and parathyroid hormone levels have been normal and the mandibular tumor has not increased.
The patient does not want to perform a resection of this lesion.
