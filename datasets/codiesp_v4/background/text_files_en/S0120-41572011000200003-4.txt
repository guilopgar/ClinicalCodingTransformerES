Symptoms appeared in a cold environment or cold water and occurred in the exposed area.
When bathed in piscin or cold water, the reaction was generalized; when washing hands or washing hands, the reaction was local.

The patient had received loratadine and cetirizine and improved pruritus but not other symptoms.
There was no personal or family history of atopic diseases.
Ice cube test was performed, which was positive at one minute.
