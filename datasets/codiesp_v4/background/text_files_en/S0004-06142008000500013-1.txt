A 75-year-old patient came to our clinic complaining of urinary incontinence and decreased voiding flow for 3 months.
His personal history included cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension.
A vesical globe was observed in the exploration and a flat and stony prostate was observed in the rectal examination.
A urethral catheter was placed and the bladder was closed with 400 cc.
Blood tests were normal, except for creatinine of 1.63 mg/dl and PSA of 8.1 ng/ml.
Ultrasound exam: Small prostate with vesical image of doubtful neoformative process.

Transurethral resection of the prostate was performed, discarding bladder tumor in the same intervention.
The anatomopathological diagnosis was ductal carcinoma of the utricle pro formative.

Due to progressive PSA elevations, treatment with maximum androgen deprivation is started 3 years after surgery.
The last control was 9 years after TURP showing a PSA of 41 ng/ml and without objective data of metastasis.
