A 40-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department in the early morning complaining of chest pain and cough.
The patient reported the suspicion of having aspirated his dental prosthesis.
The left frontal and lateral chest X-ray showed the presence of two foreign bodies in the airway, one lodged in the intermediate bronchus and the other in the bronchus for the basal segment.
It was decided to perform fexible fbronchoscopy, which showed the presence of a prosthesis with six porcelain dental crowns fused with metal on the right side, and a metal mold on the left.
Both were successfully extracted without immediate or late complications.
