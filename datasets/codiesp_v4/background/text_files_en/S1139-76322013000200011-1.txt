A two-and-a-half-year-old boy presented with a vesiculopustulous exanthema in the hands and feet of palmoplantar predominance, which was clinically compatible with a mouth-hand-foot disease (EBMP).
Five weeks later, he went to the clinic to see the detachment of the proximal portion of the nail plate of the nail from the first finger of the right hand and second finger of the left hand.
In the image of the first finger, such detachment is observed, with the presence of blistery and white areas (leukonychia).
There was no history of trauma or periungual inflammation (paronychia).
