Males between 18 and 24 years old.
Three injured sets were recorded on the right side, in the head, chest and fibula:
1.- Compression of the anterior portion of the chest with rib fracture 2 to 7.
It is possible that they were caused by the scaled impact of the thorax on an object (or vice versa) that could not completely fracture the second rib and left an external linear imprint (1mm depth).
Since the right arm is not fractured it is deduced that the latter was in extension over the head (the rotation of the omoplate allows to expose more the right costal flank).
The type of injury indicates a slow or low speed load.

2.- Complete fracture of obscure trace in the middle of the mental component.
No other fractures were detected in the regions immediately adjacent to it: clavicles and first rib.
There was only one fracture of the right spine apophysis of the first thoracic vertebra and of the first right rib, both suggesting a direct impact on the area in question.

3.- A complex of radial fractures, one of which originates in the right parietal-temporal region and proceeds around the skull in the left direction through the parietal side of the same side, ending in the medial edge.
The center of origin of this fracture was the right side of the head and indicates a great energy applied to this region.
Another important observation is the fracture of the maxilla and mandible, both located on the right side of the face.
If the fracture line of the right frontoparietal region is the same as that observed in the right maxillomandibular region, it is inferred that the force causing this fracture was common to both events.
