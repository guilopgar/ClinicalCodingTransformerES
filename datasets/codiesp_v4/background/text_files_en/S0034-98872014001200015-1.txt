Brain tomography (CT) and thoracic spine tomography showed no abnormalities.
Lumbar puncture yielded clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with 47 lymphocytes, with normal glucose and proteins.
Ceftriaxone was started and meningitis was diagnosed.
On the second day of hospitalization, the patient was alert, active, had some cervical pain and moved with difficulty due to myalgia.
CSF was repeated, showing 94 lymphocytes, with normal albumin and glucose, Gram's study was negative; VDRL, ADA and Chinese ink, as well as serology for HBV, HCV, HIV, HTLV were not isolated.
Episodes of colitis and low inflammatory parameters.
