An 86-year-old patient with myxofibrosarcoma on the posterior surface of the right thigh, proximal third.
The soft tissue surgery service performed extended local surgical resection with primary closure, compromising the deep and medial edges; they underwent a new intervention for application of resection margins.
We then received the patient with a bloody area of 13 x 10 cm. We covered him with an anterolateral thigh flap and partial skin grafts from the donor area.
The patient had postoperative hematoma requiring surgical drainage without causing flap suffering.
For flap transposition, we performed a subcutaneous communication tunnel between the defect and the donor site.
It is important to bear in mind that when making this transposition, we will ensure that the patient does not suffer any torsion or is not welcomed when fixing the flap.
