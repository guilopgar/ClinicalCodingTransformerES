A 32-year-old woman with a personal history of ulcerative colitis with subtotal involvement was diagnosed in 2004 and treated with a 3 g/day table, 150 mg/day azathioprine and oral iron supplements.
She came to the emergency room for a 3-week history of bilateral oppressive fronto-orbital headache, with nausea and vomiting, in addition to transient vertical diplopia and myodesopsia.
The patient was evaluated by the Ophthalmology Department with bilateral papilledema.
Laboratory tests revealed hemoglobin 7.5 g/dl (post-transfusion hemoglobin 10.2 g/dl); thyroid profile, vitamin B12 and folic acid determination, coagulation, proteinogram, ANA and ANCA were normal.
Complementary findings: Cranial CT, cranial MRI, venous phase angioMRI, orbital MRI, VEP and campimetry without alterations.
CSF with opening pressure > 20 cc of H2O with normal biochemistry.
Once diagnosed with benign intracranial hypertension, it was decided to remove the catheter and prescribe acetazolamide 750 mg/day.
The patient is currently asymptomatic.
There is no reintroduction of the arrow.
