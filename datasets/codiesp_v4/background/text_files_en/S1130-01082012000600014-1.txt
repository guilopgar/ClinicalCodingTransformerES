We report the case of an 87-year-old woman with a personal history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, hysterectomy plus double adnexectomy for fibroids of cells, clearly differentiated carcinoma, right mastectomy due to stage III breast cancer.
In 2010, she was diagnosed with lung and pancreatic metastases of renal origin.
In 2010, realised lower gastrointestinal bleeding was diagnosed and biopsies showed an ulcerated lesion.
Atrial fibrillation and ischemic heart disease treated with low molecular weight heparin.
In August 2011 the patient was admitted for anemia and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (melenas). A scheduled gastroscopy showed multiple lesions in the active body and fundus, polypoid, erythematous bleeding with a cerebraloid appearance.
Multiple biopsies were taken with the pathological result of renal clear cell carcinoma.
Subsequently, given the patient's age and comorbidity, symptomatic treatment was decided, because bleeding was discharged.
