An 81-year-old man came to our service with a better corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 associated with a perception of intense metamorphopsia in the right eye of several weeks of evolution.
In the exploration using a cleft palate CRA, the vascular anomalies were identified by fluorescein angiography (FAT) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) with an ARP in stage 2.
Indocyanine green angiography was not performed on the patient.
A week after intravitreal injection of benzaizumab (1 mg), the patients MACV improved to 20/2538 μ with a substantial reduction in the perception of metamorphopsia and OCT showed a decrease in macular thickness.
Four weeks later, the patient had a MACV of 20/20 and a marked decrease in the DEPR was demonstrated by OCT (from 332μ to 157μ).
Three months after injection no ocular complications were detected, VA was 20/20 and OCT showed a practically normal macular contour.
