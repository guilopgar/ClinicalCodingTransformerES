Ischemia in the lower limbs is a long-term complication of diabetes.
Patients evolve with intermittent claudication and later with rest pain associated with changes in sensitivity10,11.
They may present trophic changes in the extremities, thickening of the nails, xerosis, edema, lymphangitis, decreased pulses, cold skin, erythema, lymphadenitis or scoliosis.
Finally, ulcers and necrosis appear12,13.
Doppler ultrasound and angiography make it possible to quantify the magnitude of the impairment of arterial circulation.
Treatment includes physical exercise, management of diabetes and other risk factors.
The definitive treatment is revascularization15.
