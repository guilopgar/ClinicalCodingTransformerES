A 65-year-old man was diagnosed with colic Crohn's disease 11 years ago, currently under treatment with a 5-year history of vomiting associated with abdominal pain in the right flank radiating to hypogastrium for two months.
No loss of appetite.
The patient in this context suffers from a hard abdominal mass in vacuum and right iliac fossa.
The exploration revealed a palpable mass, not painful, displaceable slightly but adhered to deep planes.
Laboratory tests detected leukocytosis (16.79x10e9/l) with neutrophilia and hemoglobin 122.0 g/l.
Both the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (89.0 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (38.6 mg/l) were elevated.
The tumour markers (anticipated beta-2-embryoglobulin, C.A. 15.3, 19.9 and 125) were normal.
Abdominal computed tomography showed a solid mass encompassing the sigmoid colon (hueca leaf), distal ileum (white leaf) and blind (bladder narrowing) associated with multiple strangers.
The sigmoid colon biopsy showed a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with centrogerminal immunophenotype.
She was admitted for chemotherapy according to the GELTAMO protocol and died 4 days later.
