An 8-year-old male patient with non-neurogenic neurogenic bladder and bilateral high-grade vesicoureteral reflux was treated by left nephrectomy, right ureteral reimplantation and a vesicostomy for 6 months.
Seven years later, intermittent catheterization was started, vesicostomy was closed and enterocystoplasty was performed.
At 6 months follow-up, a new low grade reflux was observed, which was decided to treat endoscopically.
Deflux® was injected under and along the submucosal tunnel of the previous Cohen.
Reflux persisted in the underlying condition and it was decided to perform a new puncture.
Cystoscopy revealed an orifice in the middle third of the ureter causing reflux.
Iterative Deflux® puncture under this orifice, which acted as a shunt, allowed correction of reflux.
