We report the case of a 53-year-old woman with pain in the right hypochondrium.
Cholelithiasis was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound which did not report other abnormalities.
We performed a laparoscopic approach in French position with 4 ports.
The Calot triangle was dissected according to the usual technique, since both Hartman's pouch and cystic duct and cystic artery were visible extra-heart and apex.
After exposure of critical vision we performed hepatotomy and careful dissection of the vesicular bed.
The patient was discharged in less than 24 hours without complications.
