A six-month-old girl, born and raised in the rural area of Puerto Guzm√°n, suffered an antibiotic-related injury and was referred for neck clearance present since birth.
Physical examination revealed a lesion suggestive of a fistula, as reported in the medical history.
This diagnosis was scheduled for surgery.
Preoperative exams reported the presence of trypanosomatids from T. cruzi extended from peripheral blood.
Etiological treatment with benznidazole was prescribed for 60 days.
The diagnosis was confirmed by isolation, culture, isoenzymes, mouse inoculation and PCR.
