A 44-year-old woman with a history of health problems presented with epigastric pain of low intensity for 18 days, with no other associated symptoms.
On ultrasound indicated by his family physician, we observed the presence of a well circumscribed hypoechoic tumor that slightly raised the capsule of Glisson, with anteroposterior diameter of 1.2 cm anterior lobe and located in the left anterior segment.
Pathological studies were normal except for the globular sedimentation rate, which was found to be fixed mm/h); function tests; upper digestive endoscopy and colon endoscopy were normal.
The chest X-ray showed no abnormalities.
The computerized axial tomography report revealed the possible etiology of the lesion.
A needle biopsy was performed for cytological study, reporting the presence of a chronic inflammatory process and ruling out the possibility of malignancy.
The pathologist suggested taking a larger sample to be able to re-analyze the etiological diagnosis.
Due to its small size and superficial location, it was decided to completely remove it, while exploring the entire liver and the rest of the abdomen.
The patient is proposed to undergo surgery by laparoscopy or minilaparoscopy assisted transvaginal surgery.
Details of both techniques are given and the last of the options is accepted.
With the authorization of the ethics committee of the research of the center and the informed consent of the patient, the surgical intervention was carried out on March 19, 2009.
A single colored tumour located near the subsegments II and III of the liver was found, clearly elevating the Glisson capsule, which was completely enucleated.
The definitive histological result revealed an inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver variety xgranuloma.
