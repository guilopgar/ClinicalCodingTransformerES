A 23-year-old woman with a history of epilepsy presented with asthenopia.
He had a corrected VA of 1 in both eyes with mild anisometropia.
A peripapillary surround was found in the eye fundus, with an increase compatible with the presence of a radial artery whose center exits radial vessels of fibroglial tissue, with a morning glory papillary anomaly in OI.
The posterior pole of the RE was normal.
The visual field (VC) showed increased blind spot in the left eye.
Evoked potentials were normal although OI latencies were at the upper limit of normal.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed agenesis of the corpus callosum and communication of the frontal horns due to the absence of the septum plus a dermoid cyst in the base of the frontal lobes with signs of hydroalloyal rupture.

Nine years after diagnosis, the patient had a decrease in VA in the left eye (0.4) due to serous macular detachment.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) confirmed the presence of subretinal fluid with macular dyschisis, without detecting tears in the neurosensory retina.
Angiography showed peripapillary serous detachment with foveolar involvement.
After three months of observation without resolution, we performed an intravitreal injection of C2F6 gas, placed in prone position and subsequent peripapillary photocoagulation with laser after flattening the retina.
Progressively we observed a decrease in subretinal fluid and its displacement of the central macular area, with a progressive improvement of VA.
At one year follow-up, OCT confirmed the disappearance of foveal subretinal fluid and resolution of cystolaris with a final VA of 0.7.
