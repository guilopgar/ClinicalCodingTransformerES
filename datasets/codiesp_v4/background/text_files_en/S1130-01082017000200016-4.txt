A 33-year-old patient with chronic daily cannabis use who, since the age of 21, has abdominal pain and episodic vomiting.
During 10 years of follow-up he was admitted 7 times in the Digestive Appliance Service, once in Internal Medicine and 4 times in the General Surgery Department, and went to the Emergency Department approximately 30 times.
In 2007, during one of these admissions, both abdominal CT and ultrasound showed the presence of an invagination, performing emergency surgery.
During surgery, the invagination reported in imaging tests is not observed, so it is deduced that the invagination was transient.
A year later, in a new emergency care, it was evidenced by an echo invagination of the bowel that resolved spontaneously during the examination.
The patient maintained the habit of cannabis use uninterestedly and continued to present clinical pictures compatible with intestinal subocclusions with spontaneous resolution at least until 2012, in which the follow-up was lost after changing home.
