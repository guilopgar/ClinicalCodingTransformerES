We report the case of a 53-year-old man with a 6-month history of anal pain, and change in the volume of the stools. He was studied in another patient who underwent rectal examination, with chronic anal ulcer diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging.
Two anorectoplasty, a Z flap and subsequent dilations have been performed in this center, persisting chronic pain.
In our center, the patient presented with significant poorly controlled pain despite high doses of sedatives, severe rectal incontinence, and rectal examination with stenosis of 1 cm of the pectinate line that poorly allows the passage of a finger.
Because of this condition, it was decided to perform an ultralow anterior laparoscopic resection.
Intraoperatively, it was decided to perform endoanal pulltrough, a distal cystine and definitive pathological anatomy, being the result of the same adenocarcinoma of anal glands without mucinous areas, CD7 / CD20(-) affected
The patient had a 12-month disease-free survival.
