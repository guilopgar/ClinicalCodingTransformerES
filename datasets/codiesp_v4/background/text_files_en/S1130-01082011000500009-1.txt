A 28-year-old male with primary hypothyroidism as the only personal history of interest was diagnosed at this age with colonic CD inflammatory pattern at the ascending colon.
Simultaneously, she began with clinical and laboratory findings compatible with nephrotic syndrome.
The suspicion of a possible renal AA concomitant with CD was decided to perform a renal biopsy, which confirmed this suspicion.
Corticosteroid treatment was applied for CD, and colchicine for AA, with good outcome later.
After 12 years of follow-up, the patient has only been treated with 5-ASA, without the need for colchicine or corticosteroids, with CD in clinical and endoscopic remission, normal renal function and proteinuria in non-nephrotic range.
