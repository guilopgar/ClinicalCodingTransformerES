A 65-year-old woman, born and residing in Curahuasi, Abancay, Apurac, Peru.
The patient presented a dermatosis located on the dorsum of the nose with a duration of 50 days.
The lesion consisted of a non-painful plaque of granulomatous tissue, with well-defined borders, erythematous and papules, without purulent secretion or exudate defined.
She had no family history of disease or personal history of diabetes mellitus and/or cutaneous sporotrichosis.
The patient dedicated herself to domestic activities and manifested that the injury appeared after the bite of a mosquito.
He had received treatment with 1% clotrimazole, with no favorable outcome.
According to the clinical characteristics of the lesion, the presumptive diagnosis of fixed cutaneous sporotrichosis versus leishmaniosis was initially proposed, and mycological and parasitological tests were performed.
It was not possible to perform a biopsy of the lesion.
Blood count and blood glucose were normal.
Direct microscopic examination with potassium hydroxide (KOH) 10% showed no fungal elements.
Leishmaniasis and Giemsa staining smears were negative.
To perform mycological culture 0.2 ml of sterile saline solution was inoculated loaded into a 1 ml tuberculin syringe in the lesion and the aspirated material was plated on Sabouraud dex agar macroscopically.
Microscopic analysis with lactophenol blue showed thin and branched hyphae accompanied by microconidia compatible with S. schenckii.
The diagnosis of granulomatous fixed cutaneous sporotrichosis was confirmed, without performing anatomopathological studies.
The patient did not return to the clinic or laboratory for clinical control of the lesions, so she did not receive treatment.
