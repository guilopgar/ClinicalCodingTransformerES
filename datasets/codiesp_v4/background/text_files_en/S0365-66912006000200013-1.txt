The eye fundus of the left eye was normal.
Angiography showed patchy and polished hyperfluorescence in the area of normal choroidal rupture, retinal pigment loss and retinal detachment, which did not increase in size or epithelium in intensity, since the initial phases.
Visual evoked potentials showed responses consistent with an increased bilateral latency and a decreased amplitude, findings consistent with an axonal neuropathy of the second pair.
