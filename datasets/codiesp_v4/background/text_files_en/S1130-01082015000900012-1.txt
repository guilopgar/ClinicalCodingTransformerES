A 75-year-old man with no personal history of interest who, after an episode of acute cholangitis treated with ERCP and wide sphincterotomy, underwent six days later and after performing a chronic cholangiography failed to cure anomalies.
Three months later, the patient came to the emergency department with abdominal pain and fever, complaining of high discomfort in the right hypochondrium and sudden dysthermic sensation.
He had a tendency to hypotension and alteration of liver enzymes and inflammatory markers.
Abdominal CT showed hypodense intrahepatic lesion in segments VI and VII of 10x10 cm in diameter suggestive of abscess, so percutaneous drainage was performed and antibiotic treatment with tazocel and linezol was instituted.
Eikenella corrodens sensitive to ceftazidime, amikacin, TMPs amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin/SMX, colistin was isolated both in haemocultives and in hepatic drainage.
Echocardiography was performed, ruling out endometrium and adjusting antibiotic therapy, initiating amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.
The evolution was favorable and two weeks later, after performing an ultrasound that showed no residual stenosis, she was discharged with oral antibiotic therapy until completing one month of treatment.
