In March 2002, a 26-year-old female patient presented to our service with a consistent painless tumor, not adhered to the deep planes.
He had two years of evolution and made relief both in the submental region and in the floor of the mouth.
The patient had no relevant personal or hereditary history.
1.
To complete the study of the patient, a needle puncture (PAF) was performed and the sample was sent to the Pathology Department.
A computed tomography was also indicated where it was possible to observe the location of the lesion on the floor of the mouth, its large size and its clear limits.
1.
With the confirmation of diagnosis by the Pathological Anatomy Service, surgical removal of the lesion is indicated.
Access to the lesion was obtained under general anesthesia and through a horizontal incision in the anterior region of the neck at the skinfold level.
1.
The excised specimen was a well-defined cystic formation measuring 3 cm in diameter that contained white paste material upon opening.
1.
Microscopic examination revealed a cystic wall arising from a stratified squamous epithelium keratinized with sebaceous glands.
The patient presented a continuity solution ruled by a granuloma consisting of lymphocytes, leukocytes, histiocytes and foreign body giant cells.
1.
Postoperative recovery was very satisfactory and no recurrences were detected after 1 year of follow-up.
