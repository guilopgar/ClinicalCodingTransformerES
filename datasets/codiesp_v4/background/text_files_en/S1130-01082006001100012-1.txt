A 59-year-old woman with no history of interest consulted for a rectal tumor that had been referred for three years and had a rectal examination due to chronic constipation that required some digitisation.
Clinical examination and anoscopy-rectoscopy revealed a single submucosal nodular tumor 3-4 cm in margin of around 1 cm in diameter, mobile, analyte appearance on the anterior face.
A local exeresis of the lesion was performed, respecting the muscularis since it was not adhered to it.
The pathology report reports rectal submucosal tumor measuring 1.2 cm, well differentiated, with absence of atypia, developed in the rectum.
No signs of vascular, lymphatic or perineural invasion were observed.
On the surface it appears covered by well differentiated rectal mucosa.
On its base it shows little margin of safety affecting one of the edges, although it does not show invasion of the muscularis propria.
With this finding we propose to the patient a clinical follow-up and a biopsy of the mucosal scar in three months.
The excision of the perigastric mucosa does not show any residual tumor.
The study was completed with a presentation that did not show other tumors.
After 21 months the patient is free of disease.
