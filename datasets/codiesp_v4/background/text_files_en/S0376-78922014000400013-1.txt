Matrix fixed by a 44-year-old Spanish national male and a 41-year-old Venezuelan woman.
Both patients were admitted to our hospital with 1st and 2nd degree burns associated with intense pain after sun exposure.
The man presented erythematous-vesiculose dermatitis with areas of hyperpigmentation in the face, anterior region of the neck, chest, upper and lower extremities with special involvement of the back of both feet.
Total body surface area (TBS) affected about 50%.
In women, the lesions extended to the shoulders, anterior chest and upper and lower extremities, affecting approximately 40% of TCS.
Both reported intense pain that had started with the appearance of lesions 24 hours after non-prolonged exposure to the sun (less than 1 hour duration).
1.
We observed in both patients a linear manifestation of the lesions, with absence of them in the non-photoexposed areas, suggesting a phototoxicity reaction.
Both admitted having spilled over 48 hours before, from the head the male and from the neck the woman, an infusion made based on the coction of rude leaves with the intention of releasing the 1 hour later.
As a consequence of the extension of the lesions and the intense pain they presented, the woman was admitted to the hospitalization plant and the man required admission to the Burn Unit, where the treatment of epithelization took place for weeks.
Six months after the episode, both patients still had dyschromia and residual hyperpigmentation in areas that suffered the phototoxicity reaction, which disappeared almost completely a year.
