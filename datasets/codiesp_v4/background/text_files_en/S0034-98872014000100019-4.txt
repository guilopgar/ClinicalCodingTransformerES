Cutaneous manifestation of sarcoidosis is a rare cutaneous manifestation of pseudocystosis caused by dissemination (classic or bacteremic form) or local inoculation of the microorganism16.
The lesions begin as erythematous, painful plaques that develop a central hemorrhagic bulla that becomes necrotic.
It can be associated with systemic vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia, whose symptoms can begin after the start of treatment18.
The histological study shows dermal-epidemiological necrosis and occasionally bacteria enter the blood vessels, with signs of necrotizing vasculitis, but with few infamate cells.
Treatment consists of early initiation of intravenous antibiotics according to the antibiogram19.
