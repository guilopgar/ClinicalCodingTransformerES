a secondary haemorrhage in a 14-year-old female patient with a history of recurrent respiratory symptoms since the age of 6 due to bronchopulmonary damage, bronchorrest: under control in the associated bronchopulmonary ventilation polyclinic
There is no more history of this episode.
Within the etiological study of recurrent symptoms stands out respiratory distress syndrome, immunoglobulins and electrolytes, which were normal.
Pulmonary non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CAT) showed bronchiectasis.
Due to the persistence of symptoms, a new contrast-enhanced CT scan showed extensive bronchiectasis at the base of the right hemithorax and suggestive images of PS of the right basal posterior segment.
An angiographic study was also performed to confirm the diagnosis and eventual embolization of PS.
1.
Under sedation and local anesthesia, a 6 French right femoral artery was catheterized.
Angiography was performed in the ascending and descending aorta using a 6 French pigtail catheter, which showed, 2 cm above the renal artery, a vessel with a maximum diameter of 4 mm that ascended toward the right diaphragm.
This was channeled with a 4 French multipurpose catheter and selective angiography was performed showing an arteriovenous capillary network draining into the lower right pulmonary vein and into the left atrium.
Embolization of the anomalous vessel was performed with controlled release device coil (CAR) 5PDA5 or occlusion of the vessel in the area prior to the birth of the network after verifying that the device was stable.
Ten minutes after release, a flow cytography was performed to assess the absence of the anomalous vessel.
The patient was discharged the following day after control with tocoabdominal radiography that showed the device in the seat.
The patient was controlled at one week, one month, six months, one year and two years post-procedure at the bronchopulmonary and infant cardiology polyclinic, with optimal and asymptomatic conditions.
