Female patient, 48 years old, diagnosed with celiac disease with antitransglutaminase antibodies greater than 100 U/ml (v.n. up to 10) and severe duodenal villous biopsy (grade III).
A gluten-free diet was indicated, with thrombosis of the left lower limb and left renal infarction diagnosed by MRI.
Anticoagulation was decided with acenocoumarol.
Hematological examination showed normal values for antithrombin III, protein C, protein S and factor V Leiden.
Acenocoumarol is stopped.
A year and a half later the patient presented with middle finger thrombosis of the right hand, so acenocoumarol was restarted.
Anticardiolipin IgG antibodies were performed: 10 LPG (v.n. < 13) and anticardiolipin IgM: 35 LMP (v.n. < 12).
