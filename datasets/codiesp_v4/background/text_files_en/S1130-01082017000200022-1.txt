We report the case of an 85-year-old woman who consulted for umbilical pain of ten days of evolution in relation to an indurated tumor of approximately 2 x 3 cm, adhered to deep planes, with surgical erythematous skin.
The histopathological study of the lesion showed a differentiated dermal carcinoma type due to a malignant neoplasm composed of a central zone consisting of irregular peripheral glands, with abundant figures of mitosis over a moderate demoplastic stroma.
The glandular tumor cells expressed an immunohistochemical profile compatible, firstly, with a pancreatic origin.
Due to these findings, a CT scan was performed, which revealed a 50 x 49 mm pancreatic tail tumor, irregular, with signs of hepatic metastasis anteriorly and contact with the adjacent fat vein and central necrosis.
Due to the patient's age and the extension of the disease, palliative treatment was decided.
