A 48-year-old woman was referred to our clinic for evaluation of pain in the right renal fossa.
A routine ultrasound showed a cystic lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney.
The patient did not report any accompanying systemic or voiding symptoms.
Abdominal CT showed a localized lesion in the left adrenal gland with peripheral calcifications and no areas of intravenous contrast uptake.
1.
MRI was reported to be compatible with a 45 mm cystic mass with a hypointense thick T2 capsule that did not catch Gadolinium and did not lose any signal outside the phase.
Complete blood count, biochemical tests and ANA were normal.
1.
The sediment and metanephrines and urinary catechiae were within normal limits.
Coagulation showed an APTT (38.1 s), with decreased factor VIII activity (43%) and decreased APGAR (58.9), a pending study addressing coagulation disorders.
