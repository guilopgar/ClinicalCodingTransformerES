A 54-year-old woman with a history of mental illness diagnosed in adolescence without recent use of drugs.
The patient consulted for a history of intermittent abdominal pain and flatulence for five years that were attributed to irritable bowel syndrome.
In the last year, the patient had perceived a weight loss of approximately five kilos.
In the last six months, she had been repeatedly evaluated in the emergency department for nausea, vomiting and stools that she described as bloody stools.
In addition, she reported being worried about having exploded "gusians" in her bowel movements. She mentioned wearing a bottle to show the gastroenterologist.
The stool sample was analyzed in parasitology for suspected teniasis.
General clinical laboratory tests were normal.
In addition, CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed no significant findings.
Upper endoscopy showed mild erosive gastritis with no signs of bleeding and distal ileoscopy was normal.
Due to the persistence of the symptoms, the patient consulted a parasytologist who told him about an elongated anal membrane.
During the clinical interview, the patient reported not consuming raw pork, beef or salmon.
A serial parasitological study of stools (EPSD) and a Graham test were requested, both with negative results.
Finally, the macroscopic examination of the "gusano" carried by the patient to the parasitology laboratory turned out to be a garden baboo of the genus Limax.
The patient expressed great resistance to the understanding of the findings and was indicated psychiatric evaluation, which refused.
