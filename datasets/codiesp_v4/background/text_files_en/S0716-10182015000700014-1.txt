Physical examination revealed pain in the epigastrium with no peritoneal signs.
Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis of 11,700/mm3 and normal alkaline phosphatases, GGT, prothrombin and alpha-fetoprotein levels.
Serology for hepatitis B and C was negative.
Abdominal ultrasound showed two cystic images in the liver, one 11 mm in segment VII and the other 45 mm in segment II.
An abdominal CT scan showed a hypodense image of irregular edges, 35 x 15 mm in the hepatic segment II.
He was operated on with the diagnosis of a liver tumor to perform a percutaneous biopsy guided by ultrasound.
Histopathological findings of liver biopsy were: an inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils, the latter in large quantities.
Regenerative hepatocytes were also observed in the liver parenchyma.
For this reason, Fas2-Elisa was requested for F. hepatica, which had a value of 0.37 (normal value: < 0.2), very suggestive of infection.

The patient was treated with trilabendazole 10 mg/kg in a single dose.
