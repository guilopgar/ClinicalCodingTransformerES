A 63-year-old man presented with tear symptoms, chronic conjunctivitis and nasal congestion.
Biomicroscopic examination revealed a bilateral conjunctivechalasia marked with a fluorescein clearance time (FCT) showing high basal secretion, a clear weakened fluorescein clearance and normal secretion.

She was treated with artificial preservatives without preservatives, daily cleaning and ocular occlusion without objective improvement.
She was treated with 0.5% methylprednisolone eye drops without preservatives 3 times a day for 2 weeks.
Transient symptomatic improvement occurs as symptoms reappear upon discontinuation of treatment.
Due to the persistence of these symptoms, bilateral surgical treatment is suggested, which is performed according to the technique described by Tseng.
The conjunctival excess was removed under topical anesthesia.
The exposed sclera is covered with an amniotic membrane oriented with the basement membrane upwards.
The amniotic membrane is folded over itself to distribute the two components of the fibrinogen glue (TissucolÂ®) on the sclera and on the stromal surface of the amniotic membrane.
The glue is distributed in small drops with the help of an anterior chamber cannula.
The amniotic membrane is well stretched on the sclera to produce good adhesion of both tissues and excess amniotic membrane is resected.
The residual conjunctiva is attached to the membrane.
Postoperative treatment consists of 0.5% preservative-free methylprednisolone eye drops 3 times a day and ofloxacin eye drops 2 times a day for 15 days without the need for postoperative occlusion.
Biomicroscopic and symptomatic improvement is evident in the immediate postoperative period, remaining in the months of follow-up.
