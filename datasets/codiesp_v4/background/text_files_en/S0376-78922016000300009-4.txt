A 49-year-old woman was referred by the Department of Dentistry for basal cell carcinoma in a nasal columella of 2 years of evolution.
After tumor resection with negative limits in the frozen section biopsy, a reconstruction was performed with a frontal flap for the left side of a narrow prolonged base.
1.
The flap was left with slight tension, but this did not cause any suffering or necrosis.
Self-medication was administered at 3 weeks and despite being somewhat redundant, the patient was satisfied and did not want any other procedure.
