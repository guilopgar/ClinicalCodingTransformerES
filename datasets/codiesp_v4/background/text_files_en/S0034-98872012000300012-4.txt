A 13-year-old male, rurally resident in the IX region, with no morbid history.
She presented progressive motor deficit (left brachiocrural hemiparesis) and progressive headache.
Brain CT showed a right temporal intraxial cyst of 60 mm in diameter, well delimited, isodense with respect to CSF, without contrast uptake.
Significant mass effect with midline deviation of 7 mm and uncal herniation.
The diagnosis of right temporal hydatid cyst was raised; the cyst was removed intact and the anatomopathological study confirmed the hydatid etiology.
The study with chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound showed no cystic lesions.
The patient presented a favorable evolution without surgical complications or neurological deficit.
