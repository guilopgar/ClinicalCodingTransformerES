A 32-year-old man with no history of interest for 4 years presented with enlarged thyroid gland accompanied by compressive symptoms.
Clinical lobule: intrathoracic multinodular goiter with a nodule in the right thyroid and isthmus.
Laterocervical adenopathies were not observed.
Complementary tests: general blood tests, thyroid antibodies and hormones were normal.
An ultrasound showed multiple nodules in the thyroid gland located mainly in the right thyroid lobe and isthmus.
The lesion presented cystic areas multiseptate, with gross calcifications inside.
In the left thyroid lobe an isolated small nodule with similar characteristics to those previously described was observed.
The ultrasound diagnosis was multinodular goiter.
Puncture aspiration with needle aspiration (PAAF) was performed and reported as the absence of remnant cells.
Due to the persistence of compressive symptoms, mainly dysphagia, a total thyroidectomy was performed and the specimen was sent to the pathology department.
Macroscopically, a total thyroidectomy specimen measuring 8x6x4 cm and weighing 38 g was received.
The serial sections showed multiple multiloculated cystic spaces located in the right thyroid lobe and isthmus.
The walls were pinkish and solid.
Cystic lesion had maximum dimensions of 4 cm and had no apparent content.
Histologically large cystic cavities covered by squamous or respiratory epithelium without atypia were observed and subjacently showed an intense lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate with follicular pattern.
No significant histological changes were observed in the thyroid tissue, except for a moderate nonspecific lymphoid inflammatory infiltrate.
1.
The definitive diagnosis of the histological study was intrathyroid lymphoepithelial cyst.
The patient had no complications during surgery and is currently healthy.
