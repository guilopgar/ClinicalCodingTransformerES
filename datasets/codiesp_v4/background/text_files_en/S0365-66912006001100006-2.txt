A 45-year-old woman referred by Internal Medicine for a 12-hour history of middle bilateral mydriasis with headache, loss of vision, nausea and vomiting.
The examination showed a visual acuity of 0.8 in both eyes and a reactive bilateral mydriasis; the rest of the examination, including the papillae, was normal, except that there were narrow anterior chambers and 58 mmHg intraocular pressures.
This picture is taken from the anterior pole with OCT and BMU, showing an angular closure in the 360Â° and bilaterally.
With these data, the diagnosis of acute attack of bilateral glaucoma is established, medical treatment is prescribed for this condition and bilateral iridotomies are performed which are permeable camel images of OCT, showing the depth of both eyes.
