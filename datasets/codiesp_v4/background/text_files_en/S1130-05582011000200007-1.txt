A 19-year-old woman presented with recurrent mild pain in the left hemimandible associated with paresthesia of the mentioned area, especially in the lower lip.
It also describes mild pain when chewing molars and premolars on the affected side.
Physical examination revealed mild facial discomfort due to an increase in volume located in the most posterior area of the mandibular body and left ascending ramus.
The swelling is painless.
An external bony table at the level of the second molar area is observed intraorally.
A similar situation, but with expansion of both tables, is researched the consolidation of the mandibular ascending ramus.
Clinically absent third molar.
With the diagnostic hypothesis of odontogenic mandibular cyst or odontogenic tumor, imaging study is requested prior to biopsy.
Panoramic radiography revealed an extensive radiolucent lesion with uniloculated net limits affecting the entire mandibular ascending ramus.
Once attached to the lesion, the molar is placed in a low position and in a molar position.

An incisional biopsy is programmed, during which, according to the clinical characteristics of the lesion, a cannula for decompression is installed.
Histopathology reports a unicystic ameloblastoma of intramural growth type IIIa of Ackerman9.
1.
After 10 months of clinical follow-up ultrasound involves the presence of a gradual fixation of the cavity whose length is reduced in a gradual way, there is a reduction of the cystic lesion to the curettage of the third molar, which is residual.
