The second patient is a 30-month-old male who came to the emergency department with severe pain when closing his mouth.
The patient was evaluated in the pediatric service and diagnosed with TMJ dislocation, so he is referred to the maxillofacial surgeon of the day care center.
At the time of evaluation, the child was restless and with a half-open mouth; however, at the time of closure, dental occlusion was good although very painful.
The patient had no fever or ear discharge.
In the clinical history she did not refer any history of interest, and the duration of symptoms was a few hours, as she was accompanied by the teacher of the daycare center.
The teacher was questioned in search of infectious or traumatic antecedents, and she informed us that several children had missed in the last days because they were sick.
Orthopantomography was performed without evidence of joint pathology.
The definitive diagnosis was made after otoscopy in which signs of acute external otitis were observed.
The clinical situation resolved after appropriate treatment.
