A five-year-old patient presented with a dentoalveolar anterior open bite and increased overjet, related to the habit of digital sucking at night and occasionally during the day.
The malocclusion in this stage presented a favorable prognosis for the treatment since the morphological alterations were concentrated in the anterior dental region, showing a correct interarched relationship, an adequate profile and a favorable growth pattern.
The patient had nasal breathing and the perioral muscles had a correct functioning.
1.
The treatment chosen consisted of a Hawley plate (due to willingness to cooperate by the patient to quit the habit) with a lingual patch.
The problem resolved within 6 months, maintaining treatment for another 6 months to prevent recurrence.
