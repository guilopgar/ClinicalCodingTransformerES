A 25-year-old man presented to our Department of Surgery for a left hypochondrium tumor of six months of evolution and progressive growth.
Physical examination revealed a large mass in the left hypochondrium of stony consistency, slightly painful.
The analysis did not provide any data of interest.
Abdominal CT showed a retroperitoneal mass of approximately 20 cm that displaced the tail of the pancreas forward.
Radiologically, its structure was complex, with areas of necrosis and calcification, compatible with low malignancy.
