A 27-year-old, bisexual, polyaddict patient reported multiple sexual partners.
At the time of consultation, she had no stable partner and was seropositive for HIV.
It came from the city of Viña del Mar, Valparaiso Region.
As an entrance examination to the HIV/AIDS care program at Carlos Van Burén Hospital, he was referred for copro-parasitic examination.
He did not refer environmental risk factors.
To date, the CD4 count was 144 cells/mm3 and the viral load was 110,000 copies RNA/ml. The patient was free of diarrhoea.
The coproparasitic examination with modified Telemann technique and Ziehl-Neelsen stain detected the presence of oocysts of I. belli and Leymax Endoproens cysts with Charco
No oocysts of Cryptosporidium sp. or other malformations were observed.
The nested PCR and subsequent sequencing identified the presence of I. belli with 98%) of identity with that previously published in GenBank (N° of access GQ355892).
The patient is alive at the time of writing this paper, his clinical record registers non-attendance to his controls, reason why he has not received therapy against isosporosis.
