A 45-year-old woman presented with a four-year history of pruritus in two differentiated zones, in D2 and D7, for both.
Pruritus increased only in a hot season.
The examination was normal, as well as the MRI of the spine performed.
Topical capsaicin treatment was attempted, but as the patient did not tolerate it and instead pruritus preferred not to try other pharmacological treatments.
