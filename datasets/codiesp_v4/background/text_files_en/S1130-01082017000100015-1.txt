A 63-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain.
CT and MRI showed a solid-cystic mass of 12 x 9 x 9.4 cm with punctiform calcifications inside it and a rich vascularization occupying almost the entire lateral uteri space of Douglas and displacement.
The study was completed with arteriography that showed arterial supply dependent on the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and both hypogastric arteries (HA).
Prior to the surgical intervention, selective embolization of the vascularization characteristic of the neoplasm was performed to reduce the risk of intraoperative bleeding, followed by removal of the pelvic mass via laparotomy or satisfactory postoperative complications.
The pathological study confirmed the diagnosis of pelvic hemangiopericytoma with free resection margins.
The patient remains in outpatient follow-up and has no clinical signs or recurrence to date.
