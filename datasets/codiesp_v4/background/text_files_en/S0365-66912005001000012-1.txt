A 53-year-old woman with myopia magna who underwent surgery for clear crystalline lens in both eyes in June 2000.
A year later, a capsulotomy was performed in the right eye with YAG laser.
In 2003, the patient presented a DR in the RE, which was operated on by means of silicone oil (AS) injection and removed six months later.
In May 2004, the patient presented an episode of sudden decrease in vision and pain in the RE.
The emergency department showed a visual acuity (VA) of 0.1, a 3+ Tyndall, a wide anterior chamber and an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 48 mmHg.
In the exploration of the eye fundus, the retina was applied, papillary exposition was 0.8, and there were no silicone debris in the posterior pole.
Treatment with dexamethasone alcohol (maxidex®; Alcon Cusí, S. A.; Barcelona; Spain) 1 drop every 2 hours, atropine Wasi 1% every 12 hours, Spain Merck Sharpman® 250 mg
One week later she went to our clinic without improvement despite treatment.
On examination, VA remained at 0.1 and IOP at 33 mmHg.
Figure 1 shows the aspect of the anterior segment.
What had initially been identified as inflammatory cells turned out to be silicon oil microbubbles in anterior chamber glaucoma, responsible for secondary glaucoma.
Due to the lack of response to medical treatment, the implantation of a drainage device that the patient refused was proposed, not following the aforementioned revisions.
