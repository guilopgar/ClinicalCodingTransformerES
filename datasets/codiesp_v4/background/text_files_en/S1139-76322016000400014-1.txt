We present the clinical case of two sisters of five and seven years of age who come to the general pediatric clinic for pruritic lesions.
These are two sisters with no relevant pathological history, good general condition, without fever.
Erythematous papules, some with pustules, were observed in the glutea region, hip and lower limb root, of similar extension in both cases.
In the anamnesis, it is worth noting the history that both had come the weekend before a resort and were also bathed in a small kitchen in the garden of the house.
At 48-72 hours of bathing, they present pruritic skin lesions that had appeared simultaneously in both patients.
The lesions were cultured and positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Symptomatic treatment was given and completely healed within a few days.
