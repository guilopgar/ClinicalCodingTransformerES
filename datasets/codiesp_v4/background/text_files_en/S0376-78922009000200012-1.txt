We report the case of a 46-year-old woman who underwent surgery on two occasions due to persistent cervical sequels caused by gasoline (partial skin injections and subsequent surgery with zetaplasties).
An island cutaneous reconstruction with fasciocutaneous flap was proposed.
1.
With the patient in dorsal decubitus and in hyperextension of the neck, an approximate scalpel diameter was used and dissection with electrocautery was performed until complete extension of the neck, leaving a denuded area 12x.
Skin marking was performed with this shape and measured at the subclavicular level, with the largest axis parallel to it.
We proceeded with the scalpel up to the superficial fascia, which we included, and we began to dissect a fascia cutaneous flap of approximately absorbable width in the superior monofilament tunnel, which was previously rotated towards a 40 cm.
Finally, we covered with MicroporeÂ® and dressings with low compression; in the donor area, the defect created was cleared and closed directly by planes.
