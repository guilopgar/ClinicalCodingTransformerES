We report the case of a 52-year-old man with no history of previous abdominal surgery, with self-limiting episodes of colic-type periumbilical abdominal pain associated with nausea for months.
Consulting for a new episode of abdominal pain with defense of deep fixation.
Ultrasound and laboratory study showed no abnormalities.
Abdominal CT with contrast shows: "displacement and grouping of the first loops of and toward the right flank vascular compromise, with inferior displacement of the colon, suggestive of right PH; there are no data".
Intestinal transit: "grouping of loops of the right flank and not obstructing data".
Given the recurrent nature of the condition, the patient underwent a programmed exploratory laparotomy, identifying a hernia sac with small bowel loops inside, located on the right side, lateral and inferior to the duodenum.
Surgery was performed with reduction of the intestinal loops of the hernia sac and subsequent repair of its orifice.
Four months later the patient remains asymptomatic.
