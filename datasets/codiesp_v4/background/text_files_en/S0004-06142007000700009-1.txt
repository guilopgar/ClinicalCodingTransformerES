We report the case of a 51-year-old male patient with a history of peripheral venous insufficiency treated by saphenectomy.
Worker with no history of textured exposure.
No more history of interest.
She came to the emergency department due to swelling and right subacute illness associated with a 15-day febrile syndrome that was successfully treated with quinolones by her primary care physician.
The examination is compatible with a unilateral acute orchiepididymitis, and with such a history, ultrasound shows a poorly defined hypoechoic area with peripheral location.
Blood tests showed parameters compatible with normality and urine sediment was normal.
Treatment was initiated with Rifampicin at a dose of 600 mg/day for 45 days and Doxyclin 100 mg every 12 hours for 45 days.
The evolution was satisfactory.

Four months later, she was admitted to the Rheumatology Department after being seen in the Emergency Department, where she presented with a nodule of soft consistency and inflammatory characteristics of several days of evolution, with thermo-thermal fever without fever.
On examination, a nodular painful formation on the left side was observed.
Laboratory tests showed no leukosis or anemia, but only a slight increase in C.R. The C.T.A. shows a diameter of 3 cm and 8 cm at the level of the costal surface.
Puncture of the nodule and subsequent culture are positive for Brucella Mellitensis biotype C, with Rose Bengala Test and positive serology for Brucella.
Treatment is the same as in the previous case.
The evolution was satisfactory.
