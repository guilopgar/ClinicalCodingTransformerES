Female patient, 24 hours after birth, was diagnosed with long-distance esophageal atresia type I. Cervical anastomosis and feeding gastrostomy were performed.
After 8 months, the patient underwent esophagocoloplasty with left colon via gastrostomy and posterior gastric emptying with necrosis of the graft 72 h after surgery. Removal of the empty graft was performed.
Eight months later, at 16 months of age, a gastric bypass was performed after Vautrin-Kocher maneuver and skeletonization with preservation of the vasculature and closure of the gastrostomy.
The lifting was carried out by retrofitting approach since the tunnel could be made without mesh.
Ten days after surgery, the patient presented saliva outflow from the cervical wound of small amount.
We performed a new series that showed left lateral fistula of the anastomosis gastric.
A re-intervention was decided, finding in it a longitudinal tear of the esophagus corresponding to one of the suture points of approximately 0.5 mm that is repaired with an irreabsorbable suture.
The patient is discharged on the tenth postoperative day after a series of control.
Currently tolerating soft oral and naso-jejunal feeding tube.
