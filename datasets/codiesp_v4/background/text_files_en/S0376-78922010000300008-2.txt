A 31-year-old woman diagnosed with nodular basal cell carcinoma in the left eyebrow that required wide local resection, resulting in a 5.5x3.7 cm defect in the outer third of the eyebrow.
We designed an island flap of the left temporal artery that was tunneled towards the defect, fixing it on it and achieving complete reconstruction of the subunit of the eyebrow.
Subsequently, the patient required laser depilation to achieve complete symmetry with respect to the contralateral.
