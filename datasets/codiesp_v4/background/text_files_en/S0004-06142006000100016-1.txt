A 73-year-old man presented to the Urology Department complaining of pain in the left renal fossa and hematuria.
The ultrasound study showed a cystic renal lesion with variable echogenicity at the parietal level that measured 17 cm of maximum diameter.
The clinical suspicion of renal cell carcinoma with cystic degeneration was surgically intervened and the nephrectomy specimen was sent to our Service.
It was a cystic ovoid formation of 1500 g and 18 x 16 x 6.5 cm, whose external surface was homogeneous with a brownish-red colored colored colored tone highlighting certain focal areas of color
Cutting showed a bilocular cystic cavity occupied by abundant friable material of hemorrhagic aspect.
The wall thickness ranged from 0.3 to 0.6 cm. Contact multiple areas of calcification as well as a peripheral renal helmet in one of the poles of 7 cm. in the sinus of which there was a cystic white lesion.
The renal pelvis was compressed by the described lesion.
The hiliar vessels and the ureteral stump showed no evident macroscopic alterations.
Microscopic examination revealed a lesion consisting of tubules well formed in aposion filled by sigmoid cells with central nucleus hyperchromia not covering atypia or mitosis, sometimes protuding tubular lumen.
The lesion was cystic, finding remnants and large number of hemosiderin-loaded macrophages at this level.
Focal parietal calcification and intense peripheral fibrosis as pseudocapsules were observed in the remaining renal structures free of significant histological alterations.
