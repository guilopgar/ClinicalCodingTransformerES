A 22-year-old man diagnosed with BE in 1997 after suffering panuveitis in both eyes and recurrent genital and oral aphthous ulcers.
Treatment was started with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day and cyclosporine 5 mg/kg/day.
A macular oedema of the left eye required triamcinolone subtenon that produced a glaucoma, which was only controlled with a trabeculectomy.
In 1999, azathioprine had to be added to the treatment, but relapses continued despite treatment with 30 mg/day of prednisone, 200 mg/day of cyclosporine and 150 mg/day of azathioprine.
At the time of starting treatment with PACG, VA was 0.9 in the RE and counting fingers to 3 meters in the LE.
