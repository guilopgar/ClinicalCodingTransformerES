A 13-year-old male patient, without any pathologies of interest, came to consultation for presenting localized edema in both upper eyelids of one week of evolution without other accompanying symptoms.
Physical examination revealed bilateral edema, without conjunctival hyperemia or ocular secretions, as well as bilateral laterocervical adenopathies, rye and non-adherent to deep planes of diameter of approximately 1-2 cm.
Return of examination, including oropharynx, abdomen and cardiopulmonary auscultation, with no pathological findings.
The finding of expectbral edema requires various analytical studies including serology of viruses to rule out possible etiologies and is initially maintained with anti-inflammatory regimen and relative rest.
In the complementary test results we found: normal sediment of urine, complete blood count of 22 100/μg and predominance of lymphocytic UI with normal urine IgM/ IgG, peripheral blood smears showing numerous CMV-activated, biochemical enzymes.
Within 10 days after the initial assessment, the patient developed fever syndrome with asthenia and abdominal pain, with mild enlargement without accompanying hepatomegaly appearing on physical examination.
At three weeks, the patient is asymptomatic without findings in the physical examination and analytical control found decreased lymphocytosis (5366/μl) with normal liver profile (GOT 28 IU/l).
