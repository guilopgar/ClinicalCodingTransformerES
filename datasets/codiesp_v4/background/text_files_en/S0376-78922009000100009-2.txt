A 79-year-old man presented with a tumoral lesion in the neck edge occupying the lateral third and outer corner of the right eye, suspecting recurrence of a basal cell carcinoma that had previously undergone surgery.
Under general anesthesia, the tumor was excised with margins, including skin, tarsus and conjunctival flap for grafting, and myocutaneous reconstruction of the orbicularis orbicularis muscle with 10 mm taboo dimensions was performed.
Pathology reported basal cell carcinoma.
Fig. 9 shows the result 9 months after the intervention.
