We present a 3-month-old patient with prenatal diagnosis of abdominal tumor.
On physical examination, the patient was in good general condition, with a right periumbilical abdominal mass and a soft, mobile mass, not fixed to deep planes.
The laboratory did not present relevant data.
Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogeneous retroperitoneal formation, without defined limits, involving the aorta and inferior vena cava, with cystic areas and without calcifications.
Color Doppler showed significant vascularization of arterial and venous characteristics.
The rest of the abdominal examination showed no particularities.
1.
The evaluation of this lesion was completed with computed tomography (CT), which allowed observing a retroperitoneal formation, not circumscribed, involving and separating the great vessels from the vertebral plane.
The tumor showed low attenuation with respect to muscle tissue, compatible with adipose tissue.
After intravenous contrast injection, vascularized areas were recognized.
1.
With the diagnosis of vascularized retroperitoneal tumor with eosinophilic cytoplasmatic features, an exploratory surgery was performed; a lesion composed of central adipose tissue associated with granular nuclei, whose histopathological study described a multinodular formation in mature cells.
Histopathological diagnosis is compatible with hibernoma.
The patient is currently undergoing clinical follow-up at our hospital and has a good clinical outcome.
