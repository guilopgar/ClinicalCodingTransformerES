We report the case of a 41-year-old female patient who underwent multiple consultations over a year due to a sensation of plugged ear and mild hearing loss on the right side, which was managed as a regular ear plug.
However, symptoms increased and hearing loss deepened until reaching the conductive hearing loss defined by an otolaryngologist.
In the consultation with this specialist, a small tumor-like mass protruding from the middle ear with partial injury of the tympanic membrane was also found.
She underwent surgery for resection-biopsy of the lesion. Through myringotomy, multiple fragments of firm consistency tissue of brown color were obtained, with little bleeding.
The involvement of the bone marrow or facial nerve was not mentioned by the specialist.
In the histological study, a fragment of squamous epithelium-coated tissue was observed. It was a small epithelial tumor of expansive growth, composed of trabeculae-like structures and tubular secretions of hyperchromatic nuclei without a layer of cells.
The stroma was richly irrigated.

For immunohistochemistry stains, we used the own methodology of the Interface Patology Laboratory of the National University of Colombia, adapted from the inserts of the reinstatement.
Previous inhibition of endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H2O2, antigenic recovery was performed in Target 10x (Dako®) and serial dilutions with TBS, not used with chromoB®.
After mounting the slides, it was possible to demonstrate the positivity of both chromogranin and S100 with mild to moderate intensity in all patterns observed in the lesion.
No myoepithelial cell pattern was observed with S100.
