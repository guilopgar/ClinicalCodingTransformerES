A 75-year-old man presented with abdominal pain and digestive intolerance.
CT scan shows a cystic lesion of 14 x 7 cm of probable gastric origin.
Laparotomy confirmed an extramucosal gastric lesion with a large multilocular cystic component.
The mass was removed with local resection of total thickness of the posterior gastric wall and posterior closure of the gastrotomy.
The histological study describes a stromal lesion with multicystic transformation with expression of the KIT gene and CD34 with low malignant potential (1mitosis/50 CGA).
