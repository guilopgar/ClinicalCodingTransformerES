A 36-year-old patient with no personal history.
During a expedition to Mount Daulaghiri (8.167m high), he presents sudden loss of vision of left eye.
Despite the clinic, the patient continues climbing, and is evaluated for the first time in our service two weeks later.
The best corrected visual acuity was 10/10 in right eye and counting fingers to 1m in left eye, normal direct and consensual photomotor reflexes, no normal afferent pupillary defect relative, anterior pole.
The fundus of the right eye showed no remarkable alteration, while in the left eye there was a preretinal hemorrhage in the macular area.
1.
Within two weeks the bleeding was almost completely reabsorbed, leaving a remnant of fibrin.
The visual acuity was then 1/10 in that eye.
1.
At two months the patient recovers vision of 10/10 and there are no hemorrhagic remains in the eye fundus, only residual fibrin.
For the first time since diagnosis the fovea is identified and as a sequel there is mobilization of pigment epithelium.
