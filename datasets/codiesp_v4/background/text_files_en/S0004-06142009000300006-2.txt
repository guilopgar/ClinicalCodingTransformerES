51 year-old male patient with chronic graft dysfunction due to recurrent renal disease, who required hemodialysis resumption in 1986 due to mesangial-capilary glomerulonephritis type II.
There was a decrease in immunosuppression with CsA and addition of Azathrin, with no results.
He presents 15 days after starting hemodialysis an acute pain on the graft with progressive hemodynamic instability refractory to medical treatment.
Urgent ultrasound detected a hematoma subunit and intraparenchymatous in the graft, which was confirmed by CT, performing transplantectomy a few hours later.
During the intervention, a solid lesion was observed in the upper pole of the graft, about 4 cm in diameter, with evident signs of spontaneous rupture and bleeding.
Other solid and cystic lesions of small size on the graft surface are also present.
Anatomopathological analysis revealed a multicentric RCC within a cystic renal disease acquired from the graft.
The patient resumed hemodialysis and is free of disease and asymptomatic after 12 years of follow-up.
