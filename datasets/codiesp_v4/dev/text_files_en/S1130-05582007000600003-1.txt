A 58-year-old patient with a history of venous thrombosis in the lower limbs.
I'm not interested.
He had an ulcerated lesion at the level of the left jugular mucosa of approximately 3 cm in diameter, compatible with epidermoid carcinoma.
A cervical lymphadenopathy of 2 cm in diameter was observed.
1.
Surgical intervention was performed, resulting in resection of the tumor with safety margin and unilateral functional cervical dissection.
The reconstruction of the defect is performed using medial brachial graft of the left arm.
Blood from the flap was not taken from the ACCS, which was anastomosed with the facial artery, and the thyro-linguofacial venous trunk (TVTLF), which was joined to one of the concomitant CA veins.
The length was measured as 6 cm diameter, 1.5 mm diameter of the artery and 1 mm length of the vein.
1.
The intraoral defect was completely covered, also providing sufficient volume, and the closure of the arm skin was performed directly without requiring a free graft.
1.
The patient was discharged 10 days after surgery, observing the correct viability of the graft.
