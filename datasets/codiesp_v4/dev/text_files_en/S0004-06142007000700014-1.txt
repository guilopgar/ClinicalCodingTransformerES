A 64-year-old patient, allergic to penicillin and with aortic valve replacement for endocarditis, presented with a progressive growing penile mass in recent weeks.
Physical examination revealed an excrecent and aberrant formation of the glans, which deformed the meatus, with ulcerated areas covered with fibrin.
Fixed and hard adenopathies were present in both inguinal regions.
Chest X-ray and CT scan confirmed the presence of large pulmonary and inguinal lymph nodes.
With the diagnosis of penile neoplasia, partial penectomy was performed with safety margin.
Pathological examination revealed a pleomorphic sarcoma of the penis with osteosarcomatous differentiation and free margins of involvement.
Treatment with two lines of chemotherapy consisting of adriamycin and ifosfamide was decided but there was no response.
He was admitted again with local recurrence bleeding of large size and rapid growth that caused meatus obstruction with acute renal failure.
A cystostomy tube was placed and treatment with serum therapy was established, improving renal function, but with progressive worsening of the general condition until he died 6 months after diagnosis.
