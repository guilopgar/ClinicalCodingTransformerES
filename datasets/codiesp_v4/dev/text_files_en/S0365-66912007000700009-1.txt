This is a 65-year-old female patient regularly followed in our service after having been operated on two occasions of retinal detachment (RD) in her right eye (OD) in 1978.
The first surgery consisted of diathermy in the upper nasal quadrant where there was a segmented scleral tear and implant placement.
One month after suffering a RD, a complete scleral cerclage was placed in the lower temporal quadrant. Diathermy was performed in the quadrant due to the existence of scleroderma recurrence.
The patient presented a good postoperative period in which a good indentation of the segmented implant and prominent cerclage were observed.
Despite the absence of symptoms, in 1997 the exploration revealed scleral perforation with an intrusion of the cerclage of half an hour in extension in the area of the extensive inferior temporal chorioretinal zone.
Due to the extension of the intrusion and the extensive constriction zone, we decided to observe the patient.

A year later, the patient underwent surgery for cataract in the right eye by means of phacoemulsification and implantation of a stent coated sheet.
Seven years later, YAG capsulotomy was performed in the RE due to occlusion.
The patient came to the consultation one month later with HV in RE.
Ultrasound showed VH, intrusion of the cerclage and intrusion of the BR.
After partial re-absorption of the HV during the first month, the patient underwent a new bleeding procedure to clean the blood.

Sixteen months after surgery, the patient remains asymptomatic and without extension of the intraocular size of the cerclage.
