A 32-year-old male patient, with no relevant medical history, came to the clinic for implant treatment due to loss of upper right central incisor.
Radiological examination (orthopantomography) showed a residual radicular cyst at the level of the lost tooth.
The patient is recommended the possibility of performing a treatment plan consisting of the same surgical session, removal of the cyst, bone regeneration of bone defect and insertion of an implant.
After a healing period, rehabilitation will be performed with an implant-supported cemented crown.
The patient is informed of the surgical technique and the prosthodontic aspects (provisional and definitive prosthesis), temporalization (duration of treatment, number of visits) and follow-up (clinical and radiological reviews).
The patient authorizes the implant treatment through an informed consent.
Surgery
The day before surgery, the patient begins a preventive antibiotic regimen (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid) for one week, and if there is pain or inflammation, ibuprofen is prescribed.
A daily rinse with chlorhexidine is also recommended for the first 30 days.
The radicular cyst was removed with curettage and the implant bed was performed, inserting a universal external connection implant with nanosurface Nanoblast® (Galimplant, Sarmerria, Spain).
All defects were filled with beta-phosphate tricácia KeraOs® (Keramat, Coruña, Spain) and bone sequestration membrane bio-absorbable collagen, W (Ghusen Switzerland).
Eight months after insertion of the implant, the second surgery was performed with placement of a healing screw.

Prosthodontia
Two weeks after the second surgery, the functional load of the implant was performed by placing the corresponding implant-supported prosthesis, a porcelain crown cemented on a mechanized hexagonal metallic abutment.

Clinical follow-up
The mean follow-up time from implant functional load was 12 months.
There were no complications during this time period.
