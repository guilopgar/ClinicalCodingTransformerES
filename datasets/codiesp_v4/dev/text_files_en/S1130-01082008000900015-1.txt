We report the case of a 38-year-old male patient with no relevant past medical history who came to the emergency department with syncope accompanied by a mechanical-surgical deposition.
Location: conscious and oriented, TA 106/68 mmHg, abdomen blade and depressible, tact positive for rectal remnants.
Blood tests showed 30% Hto, followed by 23% urea and 67 mg/dl. A gastroscopy was performed which revealed normal and incipient colon and angiodys rectum lesions.
We requested an endoscopic capsule that did not find pathological findings and subsequently a scintigraphy with Tc99m-pertechnetate that showed the existence of a focal overactive area in the right iliac fossa adjacent to the iliac artery.
Surgery was performed under general anesthesia by Mc Burney incision, observing a Meckel diverticulum at 60 cm from the ileocecal wide base valve (> 50% of the intestinal diameter surface) and inflammatory signs.
Intestinal resection was performed, including the diverticulum and mechanical lateral anastomosis plus prophylactic cystectomy.
The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 5.
No blood transfusion was required.
Pathology reported Meckel's diverticulum with heterotopic gastric mucosa.
