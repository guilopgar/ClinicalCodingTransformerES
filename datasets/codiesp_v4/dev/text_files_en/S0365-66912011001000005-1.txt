A 52-year-old woman complained of decreased spontaneous visual acuity (VA) in her left eye (LE) ambliope.
She had no history of premature delivery or family history of eye disease.
In the first examination, the best corrected VA was 1 in the right eye (OD) (-1 cylinder 150o +3 sphere; axial length of 22.5mm) and 0.025 sphere in the left eye (O2255.3mm).
The biomicroscopic study of the IO allowed the identification of the Mittendor spot located in the inferior nasal quadrant of the posterior capsule and the anterior end of the IPA with crystalline content.
Adelphic eye was normal.
Horizontal corneal diameters measured 12 mm in both eyes (OA) and flattening cough was 18 mm Hg in BE.
1.
Indirect endoscopy showed mild diffuse intravitreal haemorrhage.
The course of PHA could be followed from the optic nerve to the posterior crystalloids.
The artery, fixed at both ends, was freely displaced by eye movements.
The posterior vitreous was partially detached from the retina.
Peripheral anomalies were not found, neither signs of vitreoretinal traction or retinal detachment.
The fundus of the RE was normal.
1.
The hemorrhage gradually reabsorbed over a week.
AHP could be clearly distinguished allowing a better anatomical study.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed the morphological characteristics of the Bergmeister papilla.
From this, AHP emerged that showed a tubular structure with a hyporesponsive interior.
1.
B-mode ultrasound showed a linear hyperechogenic image with respect to the vitreous corresponding to the AHP and a partial detachment of the posterior vitreous.
Doppler ultrasound showed normal blood flow in the central artery of the retina and posterior ciliary arteries although active blood flow was not observed in PHA.
1.
Blood count and specific coagulation tests were normal.
The haemovitreous patient completely reabsorbed and the patient had a vision of 0.2 that had before the bleeding came about due to an amblyopia due to anisometropia.
There was no recurrence of bleeding in 6 months of follow-up.
