We report the case of a seven-year-old girl who came to the Emergency Department due to right ptosis and periorbital pain with 24 hours of evolution, due to vomiting and nausea without common symptoms.
The patient had no personal or family history of interest, except for one episode similar to that described in the previous two years, lasting two weeks, which resolved spontaneously without medication.
The physical examination revealed a paralysis of the supraduction and adduction of the right eye, with ptosis cerebrial, without pupillary involvement or alteration of other cranial nerves.
Blood count and general biochemistry, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, glycosylated hemoglobin, anti-DNA antibodies, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-cranocyte antibodies (ENA) were performed.
Tolosa-Hunt syndrome was diagnosed and oral treatment with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day was initiated for five days.
In the following 48 hours, the patient was re-evaluated, who presented complete resolution of persistent fever and pain, with mild fever, which persisted for the following six months.
