A 44-year-old female patient was referred to our unit for volume increase in the zygomatic region and progressive limitation of mouth opening for 10 months.
The medical history was not relevant.
The extraoral physical examination shows facial discomfort due to increased volume in the left cheek, diffuse limits, bone consistency, painless, with normal skin appearance.
The mouth opening was 30 mm. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) was normal at palpation, without noise or opening pain.
The orthopantomography showed a larger left coronoid process.
The diagnostic hypothesis was a coronary tumor.
1.
An incision was made over the anterior edge of the mandibular ramus, excluding all insertions of the temporal muscle.
A fibrous pseudocapsule was found around the increase in volume, which was released.
Colonoidectomy was performed.
The patient was discharged 48 hours later.
Histopathological study reported the presence of fibers, neoformation bone and hyaline cartilage tissue.
The diagnosis was osteochondroma.
Subsequent controls developed without problems.
Final discharge was given at 10 months, with almost complete fixation of the cheek deformity.
