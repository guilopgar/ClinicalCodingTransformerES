A 47-year-old male patient, with no toxic habits or pathological history of interest, comes to the consultation andology for presenting and protracting a non-painful bike of approximately 4 years of evolution after closed perineal trauma.
On physical examination, a vesicular body is observed, with increased consistency, non-painful palpation, without abnormal pulses.
Sustained penisibility.
Mobile tests in both bags were normal.
As complementary examinations was performed penennial Doppler ultrasound: compatible arteriovenous fistula right apparently conserved; in the most proximal portion of the turbulent body with left flow duration is observed echoic formation (2x1.8x fistulae).
1.
With the diagnostic orientation of high flow priapism was decided to perform pudendal arteriography with local anesthesia confirming AVF and subsequent embolization using 2 coil 3x5.
1.
After embolization, the patient evolved favorably with complete and normal penile detumescence.
He is currently asymptomatic.
