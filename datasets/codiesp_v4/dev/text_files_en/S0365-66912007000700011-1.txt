We report the case of a 45-year-old man who came to the emergency department with sudden visual loss in his left eye.
A recent history revealed that the patient had suffered a flu episode a few days before.
Complete exploration was performed, which determined a visual acuity in the right eye, and the examination data were compatible with normality, including the eye fundus.
The examination of the left eye, however, showed a visual acuity of 0.800, and in the eye fundus there were observed macular and central foveal areas with rounded appearance lesions.
Given the patient's history of influenza and clinical picture, she was treated with NSAIDs (ibuprofen 600 mg/12 hours) and requested treatment with AGF and NSAID.
1.
The left eye showed mild alteration, compatible with normal right eye.
FFA in the right eye was compatible with normality, but in the left eye hyperfluorescent areas were observed with a central hypofluorescent point, without contrast diffusion in late times.
1.
The complementary tests confirmed the diagnosis of suspected ARE and since its evolution is to resolve spontaneously, treatment with NSAIDs was suspended.
The patient recovered the vision of unity in his left eye between the 3rd and 4th week of the clinical picture.
