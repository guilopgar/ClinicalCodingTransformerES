A 62-year-old male diagnosed in September 2003 from the radiological point of view by CT of a stenosing sigmoid colon tumor with metastases in regional ganglia and liver (stage IV).
Endoscopic biopsies were taken from the neoplasm, whose diagnosis was intestinal adenocarcinoma.
She was considered unresectable when she was treated with scope in a transverse colonic gun and first line chemotherapy with FOLFOX protocol (oxalipla-5 fluorouracil).
The patient was reassessed after 6 cycles, showing tumor stabilization. After 12 cycles, tumor progression with distant lymph node and adrenal metastases was observed.
In March 2004, the patient presented with a 3-week history of mandibular pain and swelling, a vegetating tumor in the right anterior mandibular gingiva.
A cervical CT scan showed a solid lesion in the right hemimandible that eroded bone, 4 cm in diameter, compatible with gum neoplasia, without lymphadenopathy.
Biopsy showed an independent neoformation of the surface mucosa composed of irregular columnar glands with abundant columnar coatings with irregular shapes and sizes.
With immunohistochemical techniques, the tumor was positive for cytokeratin (CK) (an atypical carcinoembryonic adenocarcinoma and CEA), and negative for CK7, which was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma.
She received 4 cycles of second-line chemotherapy according to FOLFORI protocol (CPT11-5 fluorouracil-leu gingival necrosis); and radiotherapy enxi entus was associated with metastasis 9 months after the disease and progressive deterioration.
No necropsy.
