A 28-year-old woman with no history of interest presented with voiding syndrome with daytime predominance of pollakiuria and some degree of urgency without urinary leakage.
Urocultiva was negative so treatment with anticholinergics was indicated.
Due to lack of response to treatment, a cystography was performed that was normal and a new ultrasound showed cystic parapyelic images, some of them with internal septa and bladder lesions.
In order to clarify the nature of these cysts, an abdominal CT was requested, which reported a large parapyellic cyst in the right kidney with no impact on the pathway and a right adrenal hypodense mass.
Magnetic resonance imaging showed normal adrenal gland and a lobulated cystic lesion containing numerous septa inside the right kidney; in the left renal cell there was a lesion with similar characteristics but smaller size.
The findings were compatible with bilateral renal lymphangioma.
After three years of follow-up the patient remains with mild voiding symptoms under treatment, but has not presented symptoms derived from her renal injury.
