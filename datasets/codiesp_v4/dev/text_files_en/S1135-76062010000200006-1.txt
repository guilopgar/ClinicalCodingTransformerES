This is a child who is admitted to a hospital in a situation of cardiorespiratory arrest, apparently due to a shot by gunshot in the oropharynx, as reported by family members, without this type of injury.
Communicated to the Court, forensic autopsy is performed.
Previously, a radiological study of the cranial extremity and cervical spine was performed, observing the existence of a foreign body with metallic density lodged in the spinal canal weapon at C3 level, compatible with a smaller fragment size C4.

Autopsy
An 11-year-old, totally naked, male patient with a bleeding face.
Presents as signs of medical performance punitive in both wrists and left forearms and adhesive disks for electrode recording.

After cleaning his blood from his face, we observed, on the supero-internal border of the orifice, a small excoction in the form of a right nasal semiconduct with discrete loss of substance.

Autopsy of the raquis is performed first, separating the skin covers and muscle masses, without any bleeding areas being observed.
After sectioning the transverse processes and the skull, we treat the spinal cord that is extracted together with the encephalon bulb, appraising a spinal canal vertebra at the level of the second gun.

The cervical block is then removed from the lingual base, a wide retropharyngeal hematoma and the intraosseous course of the projectile.
The rest of the structures and organs examined had no characteristics.
After the operations performed, it is concluded that death is due to a single projectile gunshot wound that penetrates through a natural orifice, specifically the right nostril, producing at this level a slight loss in the form of seal.
Following a forward-backward and slightly up-to-backward path, it pierces the hard palate, pinks the surface of the tongue, crosses the retropharyngeal area and the anterior spinal cord injured in the wall.

The morphological characters indicated a long-distance shot, possibly of accidental medicolegal aetiology, which were confirmed throughout the police investigation.
