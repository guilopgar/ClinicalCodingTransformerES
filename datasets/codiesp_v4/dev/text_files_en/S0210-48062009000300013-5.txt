A 53-year-old man.
Lithiasis c√°l.
Location of stones and size: multiple callus measuring 1-1.5 cm; left kidney.
Personal history: controls in nephrology for hypertension and mild CRF.
Right pyohydronephrosis secondary to distal ureteral lithiasis that required percutaneous nephrostomy partially recovering right kidney function.
Nine lithotripsy were performed on the right side, five on the right side (two ureteral and three renal), and three on the left kidney, although hematoma occurred after the first in this kidney.
No waves and intensity: 3,500 impacts, intensity 3-4.
Immediate post-Leoch symptoms: severe pain a few hours after the procedure
On CT scan left subclavian stenoses of 15 cm.
1.
Subsequent treatment: analgesia and analytical controls.
Decrease in Hto to 32 and Hb 10.
No hemodynamic changes were observed.
She didn't need transfusions.
Hospital admission for 8 days.
CT scan showed intense hematoma and did not show pain except for the first 4-5 days. Consequently, together with hemodynamic stability and maintenance of Hb, conservative treatment was decided, with hematoma reabsorbing almost completely in the other half year.
