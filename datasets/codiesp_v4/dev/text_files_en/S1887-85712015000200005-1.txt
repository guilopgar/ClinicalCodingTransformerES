A five-year-old male patient who after suffering an attack with improvised explosives (Impised Explosive Device-IED) in a public place is evacuated on a local care facility where he was diagnosed a fracture.
The fracture is not adequately reduced and is immobilized with a splint.
She was evacuated on the second Spanish military surgical step ROLE 2 Herat, Afghanistan for definitive treatment.
1.
After verifying the unacceptable fractuary reduction, it was decided to perform a surgical procedure involving damage control, consisting of reduction and immobilization by external fixation.
In the absence of TENS elastic endomedullary rods or external fixators for the pediatric age, an external fixation was decided by means of an external fixation of the left wrist (as a method of femoral circumstances).
In the operating room and prior anesthetic optimization, surgical time is taken, which involves debridement of necrotic soft tissues with profuse pulsatile lavage.
Median scopy confirmed the presence of a femoral diaphysis fracture with transverse tracing and consolidation.
Closed reduction was performed with control of the fracture scopy, performing an external fixation technique by implanting an external fixator StrykerTM TRIAX (external headboard method and small fragments used here).
Two proximal pins and two distal pins and verification under scopy of the correct placement of the pins.
