A six-year-old patient presented with a 12-hour history of periumbilical abdominal pain accompanied by vomiting and liquid deposition.
You have a high fever, severe skin irritation, and general malaise
Examination shows a distended abdomen and tenderness to palpation, with more intense defense in the right iliac fossa.
A complete blood count and emergency biochemistry were performed with suspicion of acute colitis.
An abdominal X-ray showed marked dilation of the loops of the small intestine in the left hemiabdomen and low right gas, findings compatible with reflex ileum.
Ultrasound shows a great likelihood of achieving a right colic framework with liquid content displacing the rest of the thin loops to the left and the presence of a small amount of free fluid interases and in Morrison's space cause, but not occlusion.

Laparotomy revealed the presence of a large ileal lymph node occupying almost the entire abdominal cavity, multiple cysts of moderate size (5 cm diameter) and a larger cyst (15-20 cm diameter).
The loops of the ileum adjacent to the ileum present a certain degree of volvulus and moderate ischemic affectation that disappears completely after return.
Ileal resection was performed, including complete resection with termino-terminal anastomosis.
Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of mesenteric cystic lymphangioma when observing a cystic mass of approximately 17 cm in diameter, with a slightly turbid yellow outer surface, which corresponds to a single cavity, multieptate.
The wall is intact and has a maximum thickness of 0.1 cm.
