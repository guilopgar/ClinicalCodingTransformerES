An inhomogeneous mass at the uncinate process with an anteroposterior diameter of 3.6 cm, erosity of the peripancreatic fat and dilation of the pancreatic duct is described in the abdominal computed tomography image.
1.
An ultrasound scan was performed using a linear ultrasound equipment (PENTAX UX 3630), excluding invasion of the biliary tract and adjacent structures.
The cytological study of the material obtained by ultrasound-guided FNAB was negative for malignancy.
With the suspicion of adenocarcinoma, a pancreaticoduodenum dissection of lymph nodes was performed.
Macroscopically a well-defined, grayish lesion of 1.8 cm x 1 cm of soft consistency with necrotic appearance in its center with histopathological diagnosis of lymphoepithelial cyst is described.
