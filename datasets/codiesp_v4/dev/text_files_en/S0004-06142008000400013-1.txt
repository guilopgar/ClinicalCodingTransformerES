A 52-year-old woman with hypertension as the only relevant antecedent.
Patient was admitted to hospital due to metrorrhagia and abdominal pain.
He did not report hematuria or pain in the renal fossa.
Vaginal ultrasound showed a left adnexal mass of 7 cm in diameter and highly vascularized, with large uterus and right ovary with normal characteristics.
With the suspicion of primary ovarian carcinoma, the staging study was completed by performing abdominal-pelvic CT, identifying a complex mass in the lower pole x 65 mm of right kidney, with severe uptake of central contrast medium.
It was also reported two other small nodules of 17 and 10 mm depending on the upper pole of the same kidney with similar characteristics as the previous lesions.
The left adnexa presented a solid-cystic lesion of 90 x 65 mm, with intense contrast uptake.
No regional lymph nodes or peritoneal metastatic implants were observed.
1.
With the diagnostic suspicion of primary ovarian carcinoma and secondary renal metastasis, total hysterectomy and double adnexectomy were performed, performing in the same surgical act right radical nephrectomy.
Intraoperative histological study of ovarian structure was reported as metastasis of renal cell carcinoma in ovary.
Definitive renal histological diagnosis was Fuhrman grade I renal cell carcinoma extending to perirenal fat, without affecting the renal vein.
