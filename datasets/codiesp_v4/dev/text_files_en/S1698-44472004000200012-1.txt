A 67-year-old woman was referred by her primary care physician to our clinic for an oral tumor of 20 years duration.
The lesion was asymptomatic and had grown in the last year, producing a facial aesthetic deformity and interfering with chewing.
As personal history it was worth highlighting hysterectomy plus double anisectomy 10 years ago.
He did not report smoking or alcohol consumption.
Physical examination revealed facial palsy.
Intraoral examination revealed a pedunculated tumor in the left mandibular gingival crest corresponding to the edentulous space consolidation of 6lan-8 cm in diameter, well defined, partially covered by a hard mucosa.
It also showed displacement mobility of 35, 36 and 38 and root rests of 25, 26 and 27.
Cervical examination was negative.
Radiological examination with orthopantomography revealed tooth displacement and the aforementioned root remnants.
Under the presumptive diagnosis of cement-ossifying fibroma, the patient underwent surgery under general anesthesia with removal of the tumor, curettage of the bone bed and avulsion of 35, 36.
The evolution was satisfactory and after 9 months of follow-up the patient is asymptomatic and without evidence of physical signs or recurrence.
