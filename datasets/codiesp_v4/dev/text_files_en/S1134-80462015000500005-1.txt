A 42-year-old woman complained of dry pain in her left dorsal area from one year prior to visiting the doctor's office. She also complained of pruritic hyperpigmentation in her back.
The feeling of itching was constant, sometimes even with the feeling of "electrical discharges".
He was disturbed by any mechanical stimulation in this area, which prevented him from wearing tight clothing and even avoided any slight friction.
A biopsy of the hyperpigmented lesion was performed, being compatible with the diagnosis of notalgia paresthetica.
The examination revealed a hyperesthesia area in the left scapular region, with cutaneous and dynamic allodynia, and hyperesthesia on the prick in a clearly defined area.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole spine showed no abnormalities.
Different treatments were attempted (e.g., topical cream, capsaicin, topical, oral, 5% patchy lidocaine, 8% patchy capsai, symptoms of pregabalin did not show any clinical improvement with botulinum toxin.
