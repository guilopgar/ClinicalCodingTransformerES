We report the case of a 42-year-old man with no relevant medical history, who underwent vasectomy as the only urological history.
He came to our clinic by chance finding a nodule in the right testicle.
Ultrasound examination revealed a well-defined image of homogeneous density, hypoechoic, located in the upper pole of the right test.
The tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein, beta-HCG, were within normal limits, as well as the rest of the physical examination, where no signs of hormonal overproduction were observed.
It was therefore decided to perform surgical exploration of the same, performing intraoperative biopsy of this nodule, which is reported as a low-grade fusiform tumor without being able to rule out malignancy, so it was decided to perform right radical orchiectomy via inguinal approach.
The patient had a good postoperative evolution and was discharged the following day.
The final pathological report was a fusiform tumor of the nonspecific sex stroma.
In the subsequent follow-up of this patient there were no signs of recurrence or progression.
