A 94-year-old woman presented with a chalaz and unilateral left eye bleach of 8 months duration. She had been treated topically with antibiotics and washing with poma venipuncture for 8 months.
The examination revealed a hard erythematous swelling of the left upper eyelid that mainly affected the pretarsal area, with thickening of the affected area and madarosis of the area.
The biomycosis shows an unaltered ocular surface without conjunctival or corneal affection.
He has an ipsilateral preauricular lymphadenopathy.
An incisional biopsy of the lesion was performed, and the pathologist informed of a sebaceous carcinoma.
Orbital axial tomography (CT) showed a large left upper eyelid tumour with non-preseptal fat, non-boneless or retro-orbital fat.
The patient is referred for an extension study.
No distant metastases were found.
Given the patient's age and the presence of lymphadenopathies, radiotherapy is indicated.
The local tumor diminished but radiotherapy was intolerable for the patient and stopped being treated.
One year later the patient died of heart failure.
