A 52-year-old male with no history of interest was studied for having found an intrahepatic cystic tumor in an abdominal ultrasound by urological study that initially impressions as a complex non-complicated liver cyst.
An abdominal CT was requested in which a cystic image of about 5 centimeters (cm) of diameter located between segments V and VIII was observed in the form of a cluster of grapes, thick septa and some of them uptake.
Tumor markers were negative.
Given the asymptomatic nature of the condition, follow-up was decided.
The radiological control performed one year later showed an increase in the size of the lesion (9 x 7 x 7 cm) located in the porto-biliary confluence, without compressing it.
Because of the possibility of malignancy of the lesion, it was decided to surgically intervene.
1.
In the surgical intervention, a tumor located in the junction of segments IV and V that advocates toward the hilium of cystic and polylobulated aspect was observed.
Intraoperative biopsy is reported as a mucinous tumor without ruling out malignancy.
Because of the possibility of finding a cystadenocarcionoma, radical excision of the specimen was decided, and complete resection could not be performed.
The dissection showed fistulization of the tumor to the right hepatic duct, mucinous content output and intracystic polypoid lesions.
The definitive histological diagnosis was a mucosecretory cystadenocarcinoma which, given in a male patient, is more aggressive.
The evolution has been favorable, receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and finding no recurrence at one year of follow-up.
