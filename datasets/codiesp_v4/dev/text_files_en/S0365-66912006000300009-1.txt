A 37-year-old male patient in psychiatric treatment for psychotic disorder, paranoid schizophrenia, consulting for decreased visual acuity.
Through the anamnesis it is revealed that in the context of an episode of non-systematized delirium of interpretation, that is, reading a book of iridology, the patient interpreted that with the light of the sun he could not change.
The patient injured both eyes concentrating solar rays with the help of a magnifying glass during several consecutive sessions seeking an aesthetic end.
Second and third degree burns on the skin of the face and arms are also self-induced to make supposed cysts go away.
As a consequence, the lesions present in the eyes are the following photoretinal lesions: iris with destruction of sphincter function, solar macule, with abundant subretinal fluid in the macular pigmentary area, and macular deposits.
Macular lesions resolved spontaneously within eight weeks, although loss of visual acuity was permanent.
Visual acuity was 0.5 in the right eye and 0.6 in the left eye.
Both iris and peripheral retinal lesions have remained stable.
