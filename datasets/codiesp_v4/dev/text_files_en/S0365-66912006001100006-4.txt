A 38-year-old woman came to the emergency department complaining of penetrating ocular trauma caused by a fragment of a cloth clip.
The patient showed corneal perforation affecting the iris and crystalline lens.
The patient was operated on from the emergency department with fragment extraction, followed by closure and phacoemsification of the crystalline lens with placement of an intrasacular lens.
In a review 5 months after the injury, images of the anterior segment were taken by OCT.
OCT clearly shows the area of traumatic iridectomy as well as the disposition of the intraocular lens.
