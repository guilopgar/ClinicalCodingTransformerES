75 years old patient, incidentally diagnosed by routine ultrasound of a solid mass in the upper pole of the right kidney.
A year and a half later he came to our consultation.
He had not followed any treatment.
She remains asymptomatic.
radiological findings
Thoracic PA and L: calcified adenopathies in mediastinum, presence of some isolated fibrous tract in left base.
Abdominal CT: at the level of the upper pole of the right kidney and in an internal situation, a solid mass of about 5 cm is observed, in its growth down, it touches the renal sinus, growing behind the vascular structures.
1.
After contrast administration, intense uptake was observed, highlighting the presence of a central scar.
The contours are clear and the encapsulated mass appears with respect to the renal parenchyma.
There were no signs of involvement of the renal vein, extension to the perirenal space or lymphadenopathy.
In conclusion, renal mass to be determined, although with onychoma.
Bone scintigraphy: increased uptake deposits at the level of the 5th lumbar vertebra, and another at the cervical level, compatible with osteodegenerative processes.
Treatment and conservative management: with presumptive diagnosis of localized renal adenocarcinoma, right upper partial nephrectomy was performed.
Intraoperative diagnosis qualifies the tumor as clear cell adenocarcinoma and indicates free resection margins (T1G1).
However, the definitive pathological anatomy report states that 'renal tumor has an apparently thyroid differentiation.
Immunohistochemical studies seem to confirm the thyroid origin of the tumor, since antithyroglobulin, vimentin, AE3-AE1, CAM5.2, alpha1 antitrypsin, calcitonin have been used in antitrypsin.
Cells are positive for antithyroglobulin, CAM5.2 and S-100'.
The patient refused to perform complementary examinations and immediate treatments, but at 4 months she began with dysphonia and foreign body sensation in the neck.
The cervicothoracic CT scan showed a mass in the left thyroid lobe of 5-3-6 cm, with growth to the superior mediastinum, with involvement of the thyroid isthmus, adenopathies of 1 cm in diameter in group y.
Total thyroidectomy and left functional lymph node dissection were performed, as well as total laryngectomy due to local invasion of the neoplasm.
The pathology report confirmed the existence of a poorly differentiated thyroid follicular carcinoma.
A complementary session with ablative dose of iodine-131 is performed.
