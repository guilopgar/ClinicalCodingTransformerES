A 25-year-old woman with no history of interest was studied for presenting a history of abdominal pain predominantly in the right hypochondrium.
Both physical examination and laboratory tests, including liver profile, were normal.
An abdominal ultrasound was performed, in which a cystic liver lesion of 8 centimeters, multiloculated, hypoechoic with hyperechoic areas and calcium, located in the 4-5 hepatic papillary segments and towards the hepatic hiye was detected.
Given the impossibility of ruling out malignancy, surgical treatment was recommended.
The patient underwent surgery due to cystic lesion of approximately 10 cm in diameter on the hepatic hilium in segments 4 and 5, on the portal bifurcation and the middle suprahepatic vein.
A cystopericystectomy with vascular control was performed without exclusion.
The postoperative period was favorable and the patient was discharged after one week.
Definitive histological diagnosis showed a hepatic cyst.
