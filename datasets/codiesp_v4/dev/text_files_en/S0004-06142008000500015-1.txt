A 24-year-old Caucasian male presented with a painless mass in the right testicle, which was self-palpated.
Serum levels of beta-HCG and alpha-FP were normal.
An ultrasound was performed whose images were interpreted as a solid testicular tumor.
The patient underwent right inguinal radical orchiectomy, with normal postoperative course.
Pathological Findings: Macroscopic examination revealed an orchiectomy piece of 5.5 x 4 x 4 cm and 51 g of body weight, which, in the upper pole and located in the thickness of the circumscribed cystic blonde capsule, was 1.4 cm.
The rest of the piece presented as the only relevant finding a cystic cord formation is a persistent, 1.2 cm diameter, translucent wall and aqueous content.
1.
Microscopically, the intraparenchymatous lesion was represented by a cystic formation covered by a stratified squamous epithelium, with scarce thickness and granulose layer, peripherally delimited by a thin fibrous band.
The adjacent testicular parenchyma reflected normal characteristics, with an adequate maturational gradient of tubular germ cellity.
Cystic cord injury corresponds to a spermatocele.
