A 57-year-old woman who came to the dental office to treat a caries in the occlusal surface of the 2nd right lower molar (47) with semi-tumoral patient without cervical extension underwent local anesthesia.
Then proceeded to carry out a drilling of the decay with the turbine.
During drilling, the patient presented a rotary rod.
The vérrez côté was set up at the same time as when dealing with turbine.
When milling was resumed, the patient again presented rotary vertebra, which was milder on this occasion, allowing obturation without added problems.
The patient was referred to the Otorhinolaryngologist for evaluation of her verdict response to loud noise.
Anamnesis, audiological tests (hearing and impeding recordings of vestibular disorders), and recordings (vertical-rotational nystagmus vs. high intensity stimuli), neurophysiological (canal tomography) were performed.
