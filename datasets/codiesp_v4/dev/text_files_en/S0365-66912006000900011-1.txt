A 13-year-old boy was referred for evaluation after suffering an ocular trauma in his left eye with a straps.
Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes.
The examination of the right eye was normal and, in the left eye, a microhyphema and anterior uveitis were observed.
A dilated fundus examination of the left eye showed rounded equatorial hemorrhages in the left eye.
Intraocular pressure values were normal (15 mmHg and 12 mmHg, respectively).
The patient developed inferior peripheral ischemia (demonstrated by GPA) three weeks after the trauma (at this time the patient had a superior temporal peripheral scotoma) with later development, twelve months later, of neovascularization.
Complete hematologic study and blood coagulation tests were normal.
The result of the sickle cell disease test was also negative.
Microhyphema and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were managed with gradual resolution of steroid secretion (1% atropine and topical steroids), eye protection for one week, bed rest for the first four days with restriction.
Due to the complete resolution of the microhyphema in the first week and in the absence of rebleeding, no additional studies of less frequent coagulation disorders were carried out, such as factor VIII deficiency and laser argcoagulation deficiency.
After 15 months of follow-up, her final visual acuity remained at 20/20 without other ocular complications.
