A 40-year-old woman was referred to our service due to the persistence of an indolent anterior blepharitis for about eight months, with an indurated nodule in the right upper eyelid associated with ipsilateral adenopathy tricha

Complete excision of the right upper eyelid including tarsal was then performed, as well as reconstruction with a palatal mucosa free graft and its re-coverage by means of a pediculate frontal glabellar flap.
The involvement of the edges in the resected surgical specimen was ruled out.
In parallel radical neck dissection was performed due to the presence of adenopathies with necrotic appearance in various lymphatic territories.
In the same surgical procedure, the conjunctiva was biopsied in the four quadrants in addition to the lower eyelid.
Pathological examination showed no 3.8 conjunctival lesions, but there were tumoral changes in the lower eyelid. Brachytherapy was performed in 94 sessions with the iridious isotope in 192 sessions.
External radiotherapy was also added to the cervical region in order to complete the surgical treatment practiced on it.
