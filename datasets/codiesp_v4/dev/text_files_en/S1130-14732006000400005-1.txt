A 62-year-old patient with a history of chronic glaucoma and hysterectomy.
It is characterized by loss of fixation memory of approximately one month of evolution, initially labeled as a symptom of a depressive process.
There is no neurological focus on physical examination.
His mother and grandmother died of cerebral glioblastoma as a family history.
Cranial computed tomography (CT) shows the presence of an expanding cortico-subcortical left frontal intraaxial process. Imaging findings in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of this lesion are considered high-grade gliomas.
1.
Initially, surgical treatment was performed through a left frontal craniotomy, with complete resection of the tumor, whose histological report confirmed the diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme.
The control CT scan of the first postoperative day confirmed the absence of tumor remnants.
Subsequently, she underwent adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy, according to the usual protocols, without morbidity resulting from any of these treatments.
1.
The evolution of the patient is favorable asymptomatic controls.
At 13 months after surgery a control MRI detected a right frontal cortico-subcortical lesion suggestive of high-grade glioma, with no apparent connection with the contralateral tumor intervened and no signs of recurrence of the intervened lesion.
He was reoperated 14 months after the first surgery by right frontal craniotomy with complete tumor resection.
The histological report confirms that it is a glioblastoma.
A CT scan of the postoperative follow-up showed complete resection of the right lesion.
Ongoing treatment ruled out adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy was decided.
1.
The patient remains asymptomatic.
Three months after the second surgery and in a control CT scan, a nodule of small right basal temporal size was observed that captures contrast and is suggestive of a new focus of glioblastoma.
The patient rejects invasive treatments and undergoes palliative conservative treatment.
In subsequent imaging studies new tumoral lesions were observed.
The patient died 26 months after the first surgery.
