A 38-year-old man who works as a member of the police force and suffers a traffic accident of a motorcyclist in quality, with blunt trauma to the left hand in hyperexhibition accident.
It is initially seen by the Emergency Department where they take radiography of the hand without finding fractures, so it is treated with bandage, analgesia and rest.
Two months later the patient consulted another medical institution for persistent pain and functional limitation; new radiographs were taken in which a distal pole fracture of the scaphoid was observed, and physical therapy was practiced for 4 weeks after closed rehabilitation.
Treatment performed in another medical institution.

A year later, the patient returned to medical consultation again due to persistent pain and functional limitation. The patient was referred to our Department of Maneuver Surgery, where we requested computed axial tomography (CAT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
With this diagnosis, we perform surgical treatment by scapho-trapezio-trapezoid arthrodesis with plate.
