A 26-year-old woman diagnosed with ulcerative colitis at 18 years of age without requiring treatment.
In October 2002 she experienced new episodes of diarrhoea of 3-4 stools/day with red blood cell.
Anamnesis by devices without remarkable alterations.
A rectal examination revealed a lesion extending 3-5 cm from the anal margin.
Serology: HIV, lues, Epstein-acquired virus and cytomegalovirus negative.
Rectal strictures are practiced. They report formation of ulcerated anus within 2-3 cm of the ulcerated anus surface and pathology of ulcerated lesions with signs of dysplasia in the epithelium covered with steroid material.
A new entity reported inflammation of a hyperplastic polyp- tubular adenoma of the rectum. The patient was referred for surgical intervention performed in January 2004 and underwent transanal resection of the chronic lesion.
After re-analyzing the patient's history given the discrepancy between the clinic, the histology of the lesion as well as its evolution in the time, it was decided to review all pieces of inflammatory biopsy, by the same adenoma-capllologist.
