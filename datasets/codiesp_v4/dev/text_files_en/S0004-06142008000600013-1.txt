A 72-year-old male patient presented with a right thyroid nodule located in another center of short evolution, with signs of airway compression.
Ultrasound showed typical images of multinodular goiter with the presence of a solid nodule in the right lobe and scintigraphy detected a cold area at this level.
Before admission, FNAB had been performed, which was insufficient for diagnosis and subsequent repetition showed signs of follicular hyperplasia, so it was decided to perform right hemithyroidectomy, with intraoperative control.
A pale brown nodule measuring 2.6 cm was detected in the piece, which was removed for histological study (see section).
After the diagnosis was investigated in the history of the patient in other centers, finding that 17 years before had suffered a right radical nephrectomy for renal carcinoma.
After 9 months the patient shows cervical swelling and imaging techniques detected multiple cervical lymphadenopathies, as well as space occupying images in the left piriform sinus.
The evolution of the lesions requires laparotomy.
Three months after the last episode, the patient received palliative care due to the absence of therapeutic possibilities.
