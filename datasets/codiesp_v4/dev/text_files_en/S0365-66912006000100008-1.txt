A three-year-old girl diagnosed one year ago with neurofibromatosis type 1 by the pediatric service.
Indications for evaluation are given in the context of screening for other diseases that are carried out in these patients.
Therefore, a cranial nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is also requested.
At this time the patient had no symptoms and the examination was as follows: visual acuity without correction in the right eye 0.9 and left eye 1.
Biomicroscopic examination of the anterior segment was normal, as well as funduscopy in both eyes.
Normal intraocular pressure in both eyes.
External ocular movements were normal.
No proptosis or exophthalmos.
Cholesterols and normoreactive.
Neuroimaging study with MRI detected the presence of a glioma of the optic nerve of the left eye.
It was decided not to treat, but to follow the patient with periodic reviews every three months.
During this follow-up, a mild proptosis progressively appeared and the patient's vision decreased to 0.9 in the left eye.
