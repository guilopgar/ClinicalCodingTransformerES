A 24-year-old woman with a history of congenital endotropy and middle rectal surgery at 3 years of age.
The examination revealed residual endotropia and VDD.
Surgery was performed according to the lateral rectus resection technique and reinsertion of the loop of both superior rectuses.
Four months after surgery, the patient presented a cystic conjunctival lesion with signs of inflammation in the upper nasal sector of his left eye.
A mucopurulent fluid was drained and a subconjunctival abscess was diagnosed.
Topical ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone and systemic ciprofloxacin were initiated.
One month later the lesion recurred without inflammatory signs and progressive growth was observed.
Complete surgical excision of the lesion was performed, which is adjacent to the surgical insertion of the upper rectum.
The histopathological diagnosis is benign cystic lesion.
The study revealed the existence of a cystic formation of fibrous wall that includes vessels and some lymphoid aggregate, partially covered on its internal surface by a stratified plane epithelium, without significant atypia or mitosis.
After surgery, the lesion was not rectified.
