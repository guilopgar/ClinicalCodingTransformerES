A 75-year-old male with a history of moderate COPD without other relevant medical history.
Among the toxic habits, the patient smoked 20 packs/year and did not drink.
No environmental risk factors or family history.
The patient debuts with urethrorrhagia and impossibility of voiding, reason why he comes to the Emergency Department.
Once the urinary catheter was not possible, suprapubic size was placed and the patient was then studied.
An ultrasound showed a large bladder balloon with apparent single diverticulum size similar to bladder voiding cyst (with maximum diameter 13 cm) with several parietal polypoid images less than 2-3 cm suggestive of bladder neoplasia.
The residual stenosis was diagnosed and treated with cystoscopy. A solid tumor measuring approximately 7 cm was found in the lateral aspect. A transurethral resection was performed in the same act.
The anatomopathological result was not conclusive, but when performing the immunohistochemical analysis of the sample, it was observed a negativity for epithelial markers and positivity for fibroblast markers: vimentin and actin fibrotic tumor, all of which were reactive.
With the result obtained, it was decided to complete the surgery, and at that time, it was decided to perform a partial cystectomy and grand resection, with the following anatomopathological result: low grade leiomyosarcoma (mitosis = 3).
Marked cellular pleomorphism.
Focus of intratumoral necrosis and multiple images of isolated cellular necrosis.
Extensive areas of myxoid change.
Intensifies intra and peritumoral inflammation.
Peritumoral fibrous reaction is defined as the thickness of the diverticular wall up to the periadrenal adipose tissue.
Surgical margins were tumor free.
Immunohistochemistry
Tumor cells were positive for muscle differentiation markers (vimentin and actin) and were negative for desmin and epithelial markers (EMA and high molecular weight cytokeratins).
With the result of a low-grade leiomyosarcoma with non-existent layer, the case was raised in a clinical committee. The patient was treated due to the high risk of the patient.
The extension study was completed by performing an extension TAC, a bone scintigraphy and a pelvic MRI that showed no distant disease.
It was decided to administer locoregional radiotherapy and complementary chemotherapy.
The patient received locoregional radiotherapy at a dose of 57 Gy.
The chemotherapy administered consisted of the combination of ifosfamide-adriamycin at usual doses, and the patient received three cycles of this treatment.
Once the treatment has been completed, the patient continues to receive revisions through periodic cystoscopy, urinary cytology and TAC-non-pelvic consolidations.
After a period of 22 months, the patient remains disease-free and in periodic reviews he is asymptomatic and has an excellent quality of life.
