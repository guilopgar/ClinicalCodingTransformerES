A 68-year-old man presented with bilateral obstructive uropathy in an intravenous urography performed for the study of hematuria from his outpatient clinic.
The patient had a history of dyslipidemia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, acute myocardial infarction, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
He reported three self-limiting, asymptomatic episodes of hematuria in December 2001, August 2002 and January 2003 without clots.
Physical examination revealed a patient with good general condition, bulging abdomen, bleaching, depressible, without masses or masses, painless to glpancy.
A rectal examination revealed a prostate compatible with benign hyperplasia grade III/IV.
Complementary Analytical Tests
Blood count: Parameters within normal limits.
Blood biochemistry: glucose 145 mg/dl. The rest of the parameters were within normal limits.
PSA 9.09 PSAl 1.43 index 15.73.
Systematic urine study: PH6.5, density 1.016, negative for proteins, colonic bodies, bilirubin, nitrites, urobilinogen and leukocytes, 0.50 g/l glucose and 50 Î¼l blood.
Urine sediment: 1-2 stools per field.
Benign cytology (negative for malignancy).
Imaging Techniques
Plain abdominal radiography: Calcifications in the minor pelvis of possible vascular origin.
Good distribution of intestinal gas.
Visible psoas lines
UIV: Kidneys of size, shape and location within normal limits.
Bilateral and symmetrical renoureteral elimination with dilatation of the left renal collector, upper-middle third of the left ureter with image of decreased caliber at the level of the pelvic region that may be related to radiotransparent calculus.
Right renal calculus does not show alteration at the level of the pelvic ureter, defect of repletion in a possible relation with radiolucent calculus.
Cystography showed irregular bladder suggestive of trabeculations with marked prostatic imprint.
Left pyelography: Hydronephrosis with contrast passage to bladder defect replacement at the level of pelvic ureter, about 5 cm of bladder.
1.
Abdominal-pelvic CT: Moderate bilateral hydronephrosis (26 cm right renal pelvis and approximately 29 cm left in transverse axis).
In both distal ureters, approximately 5 cm away from the urinary bladder, intraureteral content is observed, with soft tissue density, suggestive of bilateral urothelioma, occupying approximately 2 cm non-early structures.
1.
Pelvic MRI: Left kidney dilation without being able to identify the exact cause of the stenosis.
Treatment
Median transperitoneal midline laparotomy ureteral tracts are exposed from lumbar to juxtavesical area objectifying two mobile intraureteral masses of approximately 2 cm in length, with normal periureteral tissue appearance.
A bilateral longitudinal incision was made, appreciating two papillary neoforms base of pediculae implantation and removal.
Pig-tail placement and urethrotomy closure.
Anatomy, Pathological
Macroscopic description: An irregular, white-brown fragment measuring 3x2.5x1.2 cm on the left and 3x2.5x1.2 cm on the right.
The section recognizes the central axis in both.
Microscopic description: Tumors of both ureters have a similar appearance.
Papillary stricture to urothelial carcinoma, low cytological grade, with connective-vascular axes covered by multiple urothelium rows with mild pleomorphism and exceptional mitosis.
Both have muscle-vascular axis, tumor free contact, although in areas the tumor apparently has no underlying chorion.
The resection base showed free fulguration.
At the level of the left tumor in one of its edges, there is papillary proliferation, while the opposite is preserved urothelium without significant dysplasia.
On the right side, both edges appear free, although in one of them there is rest of a rounded papillary tumor.
Final Diagnosis
Patent urothelial papillary carcinoma G1 difficult stage, probably T1.
Ev
The patient was discharged after 14 days of admission, during which he presented fever secondary to right basal pneumonia that responded satisfactorily to antibiotic treatment.
The patient also presented with a paralytic ileus that developed after conservative measures.
He came 10 days later to remove pigtail without complications.
In his first review after surgery, three months later, the patient is asymptomatic from the urological point of view presenting normal intravenous urography.
