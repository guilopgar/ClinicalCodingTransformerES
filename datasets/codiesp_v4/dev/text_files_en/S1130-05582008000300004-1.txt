A 37-year-old male patient presented with a 6-year history of a right paramandibular nodule that had increased in size in the last year.
Located that the lesion appeared after the extraction of a lower molar.46
On physical examination, the patient had a nodule of 1.5 cm in diameter, at the bottom of the vestibule, at a height of 45 and theoretician
The lesion was mobile, well delimited, with elastic consistency and painful to palpation.
The adjacent mucosa was normal.
Orthopantomography showed no mandibular pathology.
Resection of the lesion was performed under local anesthesia, previously locating the chin nerve exit to preserve it.1
1.
Macroscopically it was a nodular, well-defined, whitish lesion of 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm in size.
Microscopically, the lesion was composed of uniform spindle cells, with poorly defined cytoplasmic limits, oval nuclei or nuclei, without mitoses or nuclear pleomorphism.
The cells were arranged randomly intermingled with collagen fibers and isolated blood vessels.
There were no areas of necrosis or hemangiopericytoid pattern.
On the periphery, the lesion was delimited by a connective tissue ribet.
1.
Immunohistochemically, the lesion cells were: strongly positive for vimentin, CD34 and bcl2, weakly positive for: factor XIIIa and actin muscle-specific protein (1AHFA4); and Scl2-negative.
1.
Post-operative recovery was uneventful and there were no signs of local or regional recurrence one year after surgery.
