A 29-year-old patient who consulted for pain in the right test three months ago was referred to our outpatient clinic for antiarrhythmic medication.
One month later she had a new picture of pain in the right testicle that was diagnosed with orchiepididymitis but which was not resolved with medical treatment.
As personal history only stands out being allergic to Sulfamides.
No relevant urological history.
Physical examination revealed a tumour in the inferior pole of the right indolent test.
The suspicion of testicular tumor was requested a complete blood analysis with tumor markers and testicular ultrasound, with results of AFP 36.4 ng/ml and Beta-hCG 4.2 mUI/ml.
Ultrasound showed a 23 mm tumor in the lower pole of the right test for non-cystic lesions consistent with neoplasia.
He was operated on by means of a right inguinal radical orchiectomy whose Pathological Anatomy reports a 2 cm Germ Cell Tumor formed by mixed Teraiontoma Locations and surgical focus.
No vascular or lymphatic invasion.
Algae, cord is persistent and tumor-free epididymis.
Because it is a nonseminomatous Germinal Tumor in Stage I, it was decided by mutual agreement with the patient not to receive adjuvant chemotherapy treatment and follow strict observational control.
The patient was periodically monitored according to the protocol of our test. The patient did not undergo any disease-free laboratory tests on imaging techniques, clinically and analytically for 7 years and a half until a single ultrasound study showed a calcified testicular nodule x microcalcium Doppler mm.
A left varicocele is also observed.
Physical examination is normal and tumor markers are normal.
After left inguinal orchiectomy, the Pathological Anatomy reports a Seminoma of 0.5 cm that capsule over atrophic testicle with extensive Intratubular Neoplasia of Germ Cells.
Non vascular or lymphatic.
Chemotherapy and hormone replacement therapy were completed.
She is currently 4 years free of disease.
