A 38-year-old male with no relevant past medical history was referred to the urology department for a vasectomy.
Physical examination revealed a normal subject with penis, tests and epididymis of normal size and consistency.
The right deferent duct was clearly identified.
This was not the case with left vas deferens which were not achieved within the cord.
The rectal examination was abnormal.
A transrectal ultrasound was performed in which the left seminal vesicle was not visualized.
One UIV revealed complete absence of the left kidney.
Subsequently, a MRI confirmed the absence of the seminal vesicle, left vas deferens and ureter.
The patient was scheduled for vasectomy, which was performed without incidents on the right side.
The control seminograms performed three months after the intervention revealed a complete azoospermia confirming the clinical suspicion of agenesis associated with renal agenesis and ipsilateral seminal vesicle agenesis.
First-degree relatives (two children, male brother and two children of the patient) were advised to perform an ultrasound study, given the potential autosomal dominant transmission of both kidneys in the presence of renal agenesis.
The sweat test in the patient was also negative.
