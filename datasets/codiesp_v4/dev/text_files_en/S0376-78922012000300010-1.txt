A 51-year-old woman presented with a painless tumor in the left upper eyelid that was perceptible to the touch and had a firm consistency.
In addition, the existence of associated blepharopharochalasia is confirmed.
1.
The patient reported a history of transconjunctival excision of chalazion 2 years earlier, with recurrence of the lesion soon.
The ocular functional examination is normal.
We requested a CAT scan with contrast of the facial mass in which we found a solid formation in the supero-external region of the orbital gland, without involvement of the eyeball, with the lacrimal gland
1.
We decided, according to the patient, to perform surgical resection of the tumor and at the same time to perform associated upper and lower aesthetic blepharoplasty.
The intraoperative finding of the lesion was a 1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm diameter malformation of the left nipple with elastic consistency, which could not be visualized and could be completely removed.
The superior blepharoplasty was performed according to the technique and the inferior blepharoplasty was performed by transconjunctival approach extirpation of classical pits with both superior and inferior classic pits.
1.
The postoperative evolution of the patient was good, without complications, with a very satisfactory aesthetic result and without tumor recurrence after 12 months of control.
1.
Anatomopathological study of the resection specimen reported that it was a more defined tumour (non-resecting adenoma, areas with well-defined capsule, consisting of fascicles of spindle cells arranged in an alternating pattern or atypical, respectively).
Immunologically, the S-100 protein was positive confirming the diagnosis of eyelid disorder.
