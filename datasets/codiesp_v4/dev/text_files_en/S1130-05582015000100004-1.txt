We report the case of a 60-year-old woman, non-smoker or bicuspid bicuspid drinker, with no relevant clinical history, who did not refer relevant medical or surgical procedures and attended our service to perform a left lower extraction.
At the time of intraoral clinical examination an asymptomatic tumor lesion of 15 mm in diameter in the left oral mucosa is observed.
Its color is pale pink, similar to that of the mucosa and surface.
A 10 mm diameter tumor lesion was observed in the right oral mucosa.
This lesion is hypochromic compared with the buccal and surface mucosa.
The provisional diagnosis for both lesions is a traumatic fibroma associated with a poorly adapted prosthesis.
At the time of the patient's medical history, she did not seek medical advice because she was treated for facial deformities with biopharmaceuticals.
The diagnostic method is an excisional biopsy and the treatment is surgical removal.
The excision is performed by anaesthetizing the area.
The incision was made with a 15 scalpel blade and the posterior suture with 3-0 black silk.
The right lesion was closed with Vicryl and then black silk 3-0.
At the time of surgical excision of the left lesion, the macroscopic aspect is due to its internal coloration and encapsulation.
1.
For the left lesion the microscopic study indicates a reactive lesion covered by a stratified flat lining epithelium of variable thickness.
Epithelial debate shows a lesion formed by abundant collagen fibers arranged randomly between mixed with some blood vessels outlined by the endothelium of normal appearance.
This confirms that it is a traumatic fibroma.
The histopathological study of the lesion of the right mucosa reveals the presence of abundant empty rounded spaces surrounded by numerous foamy histiocytes, which indicates that they are phagocytosing lipids and lipids.
After obtaining the images of the microscopic examination, the patient indicates that 10 years earlier she had been subjected to treatment for facial deformities involving facial biosynthesis in the forehead and commissures.
The patient reported no symptoms associated with adverse effects.
