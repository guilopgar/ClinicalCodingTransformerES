We report the case of an 81-year-old man with a history of hypertension in treatment, inguinal hernia repaired 20 years before and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
Three days before his death, he had epigastric pain, which was referred to his bedside physician and electrocardiogram was reported as normal.
Pain improved, but despite this, the patient developed nausea and syncope, which was diagnosed by the emergency medical service, who only believed death.
During the autopsy, a supraumbilical midline laparotomy scar was evident, which was not the reason for its pathological history, since the only documented intervention was due to an inguinal hernia.
The cause of death in this case was a hemopericardium secondary to rupture of transmural infarction in the left ventricular free wall and severe coronary atherosclerosis of the three vessels.
An autopsy finding suggestive of changes in our attention was the presence of external morphology of the stomach, with a hyperemic, retractable appearance, with disseminated and dilated nodules.
When these nodules were cut, they presented blackish and fruity contents that recalled pepitations.

The histological study determined that it was an evolved and calcified destructive fibrosis in relation to remains of suture material (silk).
