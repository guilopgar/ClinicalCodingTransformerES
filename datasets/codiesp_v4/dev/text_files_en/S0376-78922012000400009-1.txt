A 34-year-old patient presented with penile deformity secondary to repeated treatment of thickening.
Located at the end of 8 months, she underwent 3 fat transfer sessions performed in her country by a specialized professional.
Four months later, the patient developed spontaneous pain that increased during erection, which made it impossible for him to cook.

On physical examination, the patient presented a horizontally shaped penis (grossor), with visible irregularities, which were found to be painful.
Located tumors are located between 1 and 3 cm in diameter.
Clinical examination and history of fat inclusion referred to the patient guide the diagnosis and etiology of the problem.
A radionuclide lymphography was requested to rule out possible lymphedema.
The report tells us that lymphatic vessels and regional ganglia are located (10,11).
Surgical Treatment
We planned to remove the tumors that cause the deformity.
In the surgical environment and under general anesthesia, a Foley No. 16 vesical catheter was placed in order to control the tact of the urethral path and therefore also of the spongy body that houses it.
We focused the penis in its midline ventral and proceeded to dissect and remove each of the tumors that could be identified, trying not to damage the noble structures of the penis.
Once complete resection of the tumors has been achieved, careful hemostasis is performed and the incision is closed in layers taking into account the different layers of the penis in the tegumentary layer.
Let's drain.
The changes achieved are already visible at the end of the intervention.

In the anatomopathological study it was found that the lesions were made up of fat globules and some had inside foci of cytostenotonecrosis.
