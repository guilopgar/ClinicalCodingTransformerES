A 67-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hiatal hernia in medical treatment who came to the urology clinic for self-limiting monosymptomatic hematuria.
Physical examination revealed no relevant findings.
In blood analytical determinations all parameters were within normal limits.
Intravenous urography showed a repletion defect in the right renal pelvis which was later confirmed by abdominal computed tomography which showed a mass in the pelvis that amputees medium.
Cytologies were negative.
Right nephroureterectomy was performed.
In the first time, endoscopic ureteral disinsertion was performed, with the technical modification subsequently described for performing the nephroureterectomy through a right subcostal incision.
In the description of the specimen a vegetating, exophytic and papillary lesion occupying the caustic medium and part of the renal pelvis without parenchyma was observed.
Microscopically, the tumor is reported as a high grade urothelial carcinoma that does not affect the lamina propria (Ta G3).
After four years of follow-up the patient is alive and disease free.
