A 46-year-old man complained of constipation and pain in the upper hemiabdomen for 7 days.
Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed an 11 x 12 x 7 cm mass dependent on the descending colon and a left hemicolectomy was performed.
The pathological study showed a fusiform cell tumor with low mitotic activity that, after ultrastructural and immunohistochemical examination (IHC), was diagnosed of GANT.
Five months later, the patient presented a double recurrence located at the junction of the omentum and adjacent to the cecum wall which was completely resected.
Adjuvant treatment with imatinib 400 mg daily orally was performed.
After 24 months of follow-up there were no recurrences or metastases.
