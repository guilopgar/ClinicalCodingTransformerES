In 1995, at age 40, a mastectomy with axillary dissection was performed in another city.
The histological report was lobulated carcinoma.
The maximum diameter of the primary tumor was 3 cm (T2).
Fourteen lymph nodes were isolated from the axilla, 4 of which were infiltrated by the tumor; further data on hormone receptors could not be accessed.
After the intervention she received complementary chemotherapy with six cycles of ECF.
In 2000 she began suffering from epigastric pain accompanied by a weight loss of more than 10 kg.
In November 2000, a mass of tumor appearance in the gastric body was found by gastroscopy.
Biopsy was reported as diffuse adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells.
In January 2001, a laparotomy was performed in which ascites and an unresectable gastric neoplasm affecting the stomach wall and affecting the head of the pancreas were found.
Ascitic fluid cytology was compatible with signet ring cell invasion.
Cytologic treatment with chemotherapy was initiated.
In December 2001 she began with back pain; in the bone scintigraphy multiple uptakes compatible with bone metastases were found and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging.
Since then, it has been treated with analgesic radiotherapy and has also received several lines of chemotherapy and hormonal treatment that it currently maintains.
The prolonged survival of the patient encouraged to expand the gastric biopsy studies that allowed to confirm the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in signet ring cells.
