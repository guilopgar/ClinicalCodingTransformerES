A clinical case is presented: female patient, 34 years old, couple of addiction, with two children negative for HIV.
Positive since 1995, he declared himself single and employed housewife.
The patient was presented to the outpatient clinic during the first days of March 2005.
On admission, negative values were recorded for VDRL, Chagas, Toxoplasmosis, Superficial Anvirus for Hepatitis B and positive for Hepatitis C and Cytomegalo (CMV).
The CD4+ cell count resulted, at that time, in 125 cells/dl (chronic sclerosis), with the result of the viral load in tramitis.
An antiretroviral treatment regimen for D4T, 3TC and EFAVIRENS was established.
The patient returned 45 days later, complaining of significant weight loss, night sweats and a painless nodule at the upper right level, according to medical description.
Hospitalization was indicated.
A routine analysis reported a 32% hematocrit, 10 hemoglobin and 3,800 white blood cells.
The medication was discontinued due to intolerance.
Inside the extended portion, a stomatologist reported that the patient did not present oral candidiasis or odynophagia, but three ongoing lesions were observed: one at the level of the right upper canine
In the posterior zone, an everted edge ulcer of necrotic background extended to the posterior zone of the molars.
These three lesions evolved daily taking greater proportions and including the soft parts of the facial region.
1.
Upon general observation, the abdomen was smooth and painless.
A new blood test showed hematocrit of 275, hemoglobin of 9.3% and white blood cells: 8,100; platelets: 237,000.
The patient's evolution denotes signs of failure, without fever.
Doppler ultrasound and CT angiography were performed.
Three biopsies were taken from the oral tumor that had advanced throughout the alveolar ridge to the posterior hamular area and to the hard palate and blade on the same side.
A 2 cm long ulcer of 1.5 width was located in the alveolar ridge in the molar zone and in the incisal zone, a conical bulging protrusion with an extreme ulcerated diameter of 2 cm.
1.
The result of the histological report of the oral lesions revealed a "morphologically lymphoid cell proliferation consisting of cells of smaller to large size with two or more neighboring nuclei and evident eosinophils.
There are numerous mitotic figures with high proliferation index, immunoblastic type to large cells".
Immunohistochemical staining revealed B-cells and positive staining for CD 79, CD209, and CD22 antigens.
Tumor cells are negative for epithelial markers CD56, CD57, CD50 and CD15.
Diffuse histiocytic lymphoma of large cells".
The oncological team initiated the first cycle of ERORH (prednisone+etoposide+dexamethasone+cyclophosphamide + vincristine).
CD4 titre > 100.
Postoperatively, the patient developed neutropenia, fever, candidiasis in the perianal area due to active herpes virus.
The second cycle of chemotherapy was established, with general improvement without complications.
The patient was discharged on 14/6/05 with indications for CMV treatment and with antiretroviral therapy (ARV) with D4T, EFV and Â·3TC.
The patient returned with a very poor general condition, so she was hospitalized again.
A new magnetic resonance imaging study revealed multiple nodular images in the liver and kidney, compatible with lymphoma.
In addition, reactivation of the very painful anal herpes virus was medicated with indinavir 800 mg daily and amphotericin B + TMS at PCP doses.
Orofacial non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed as having a high degree of malignancy had already compromised the entire right hemiface and had higher proportions of invasion fig.
During daily inspection, signs of the same disease were diagnosed in the intra-abdominal area and pericardium.
There was a deterioration of the general state with persistent vomiting and nausea, generalized pain, prostration, oral and esophageal candidiasis and on 6/9/05, the patient died, febrile neutropenia, at six months.
