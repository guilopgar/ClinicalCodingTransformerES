Erythema and conjunctival inflammation were also observed, and the rest of the physical examination was normal.

With a presumptive diagnosis of SSEPS, he was admitted and started treatment with cloxacillin i.v., topical mupirocin, i.v. antihistamine, IV fluid therapy, and analgesia.
The evolution was initially unfavorable, with generalization of the lesions and extension of the erythrodermia.
On the third day, it is empirically associated with treatment with intravenous clindamycin. At 24 hours, a very favorable evolution of the lesions was observed.
Later the hemocultive was informed as negative and the culture of cutaneous and nasal swabs was positive for S. aureus (resistant to penicillin, sensitive to cloxacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and clinda).
After six days of admission with parenteral treatment it was decided to discharge to continue antibiotic treatment on an outpatient basis.
