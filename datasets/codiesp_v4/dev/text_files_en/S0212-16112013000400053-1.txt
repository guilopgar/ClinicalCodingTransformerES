A 60-year-old woman diagnosed with stenosing antral gastric neoplasia.
A subtotal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction was performed.
On day +7, the patient suddenly deteriorated with peritonitis data, so she underwent emergency laparotomy, necrosis of lesser gastric curvature and distal esophageal face.
Transsection and closure of the abdominal esophagus and gastric stump were performed. Esophageal exclusion with cervical feeding was performed, and an ERCP was performed.
The patient was discharged with an EEN due to a stenosis.
Three months later, the patient was readmitted to hospital for digestive tract infection, with prior confirmation of infection and computed tomography in which no data suggesting tumor recurrence were observed.
During surgery, multiple micronodules were observed at the level of the transverse colon and in the region corresponding to the gastroheptic epiptomy, with intraoperative pathological anatomy compatible with signet-ring cells, which was suspended indefinitely.
