A 77-year-old woman with a single history of hypertension.
He had a clinical picture consisting of gait ataxia, sphincter incontinence and upper function disorder.
Neuroimaging studies showed dilation of the ventricular system, so when there was suspicion of AHC, a DLE was placed.
Thirty hours after placement, the patient suddenly began to present headaches and vomiting not associated with orthostatism.
There was no deterioration of the level of consciousness.
There were 510 ml CSF in the drainage bag.
A cranial CT scan showed a transversely disposed hematoma in the left cerebellar hemisphere with little mass effect.
Having established the findings and the clinical situation of the patient, it was decided to remove the LLD and conservative treatment.
Brain MRI performed before admission ruled out underlying pathology.
Five days later the patient was discharged with recovery to his premorbid condition.
1.
No shunt was implanted because no improvement was observed with the placement of DLE.
